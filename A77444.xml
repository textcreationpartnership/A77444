            <title>An historicall vindication of the government of the Church of Scotland from the manifold base calumnies which the most malignant of the prelats did invent of old, and now lately have been published with great industry in two pamphlets at London. The one intituled Issachars burden, &amp;c. written and published at Oxford by John Maxwell, a Scottish prelate, excommunicate by the Church of Scotland, and declared an unpardonable incendiary by the parliaments of both kingdoms. The other falsly intituled A declaration made by King James in Scotland, concerning church-government and presbyteries; but indeed written by Patrick Adamson, pretended Archbishop of St. Andrews, contrary to his own conscience, as himselfe on his death-bed did confesse and subscribe before many witneses in a write hereunto annexed.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat I give to you an account of this my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent taske, it is no more then what often I have done in my other ſtudies with your good acceptance and my great profit. When I look back (as frequently I doe with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull remembrance) towards thoſe yeers of my childhood and youth, wherein I did ſit under your Diſcipline, my heart bleſſes the goodneſſe of God, who in a very rich mercy to me, did put almoſt the white and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed table of my ſpirit under your hand, after my domestick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which were from mine infancy, to be engraven by your labours and example with my firſt moſt ſenſible and remaining impreſſions, whether of piety or of good letters, or of morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: What little portion in any of theſe, it hath pleaſed the Lord of his high and undeſerved favour to bestow upon me; I were ungratefull if I ſhould not acknowledge you after my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the firſt and principall inſtrument thereof. I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that ſince the eleventh yeer of mine age to this day, in my inmoſt ſenſe, I have alwayes found my ſelfe more in your debt, then in any other mans upon earth.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:135324:3"/>
            <p>Among the many bleſſings wherein God kath made you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall towards me, this was one not the leaſt, that by your gracious and moſt loving diſcourſes, you ſo ſeaſoned my childiſh heart with an early love towards the ancient oppreſſed Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of our Church and the Patrons therof, that no after ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were ever able totally to extinguiſh it: You did ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh me with narrations of the more then ordinary graces of many both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> who had lived and dyed in oppoſition to Epiſcopall uſurpations, that my spirit was ever thereafter kept in a reluctancy and a kind of averſneſſe from the Prelaticall wayes.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe, after you, to my exceeding great griefe and loſſe, were taken away from my head, and I came to be ſet at the feet of other Masters, especally Mr. <hi>Cameron</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> my very ſingular friends and excellent Divines as our Nation has bred, I was gained by them to ſome parts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, which if the Lords mercy had not prevented, might have led me, as many my betters; to have run on in all the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and defections of theſe bad times: but thanks to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious name, who held me by the hand, and ſtopped me at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and firſt entry of that unlucky courſe; who before I had put my hand to any ſubſcription, or was engaged in any promiſe, or had practiſed any the leaſt Ceremony in my Flock, did call me to a retreat.</p>
            <p>The remainder of your ancient instructions, and the ſight of your ſufferings: the happy fellowſhip and ſweet ſociety of that moſt precious man Master <hi>Dickſon,</hi> of old yours, and now my moſt gracious Colleague, were to me ſtrong retractives and wholeſome antidotes againſt all the infections of the ayre, wherein I did live; till the Lord ſent to me and many others, that ſoveraigne remedy of all the Epiſcopal Gangreen, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ungracious Service-book: So ſoon as that came into my lands, together with ſome late writs of the Canterburian and Court Divines, which I did carefully look into as the true and
<pb facs="tcp:135324:3"/>juſt Commentaries both of that Book, and all the reſt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of that party, which then did manage the publick Counſels both Eccleſiastick and Civill of Britaine: I did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that their Deſigne was wicked, that their intentions were cleer to corrupt the Church, and to enſlave the State, that all their former innovations were but introductory meanes and adminicles for theſe ends: Whereupon I reſolved by the grace of God upon all hazards, to contradict and oppoſe (ſo far as it was lawfull for me to move in my spheare) all not onely their late groſſer, but alſo their former more ſubtill and plauſible corruptions. This ever ſince has been the greateſt part of my labour, and thanks to God, not without ſome fruit, especially to ſuch who had ſtumbled more or leſse upon the block of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity, which was the condition, as you know of the farre moſt part in the whole Iſle.</p>
            <p>At this time I did not think of any farther conteſt with that party; the hand of God by the Counſels and Forces of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and by the labours of many gracious Divines of both Kingdomes, having ſo broken and defeated that enemy, that there was no more feare, and ſcarce any thought of him among us, yet behold an unexpected neceſſity of one bout more with him.</p>
            <p>The wofull Anarchy wherein the perverſneſſe of ſome few men, by the permiſſion and heavy plague of God, has for too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeers kept the Church of <hi>England,</hi> has produced ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of hereſies and ſchiſmes, as no heart in the which is the leaſt sparkle of love to God, or of zeale to his truth, can behold without a great deale of griefe and compaſſion, and now alſo with ſome piece of indignation. For to many of thoſe ſeduced ſoules, upon their feare and preſage of ſome controlement and restraint of their liberty to beleeve what they liſt, and preach what they beleeve, if once any government were ſet up in the Church; they become angry with all whoſe conſcience pouſſes them after ſo long patience, to preſſe for ſome ſetling of our ſo
<pb facs="tcp:135324:4"/>great and unheard of confuſions: And becauſe in this deſire the Scots are with the firſt, according to their intereſt which they have bought at a very deare rate, there ore upon them with the firſt, the paſſions of thoſe miſled people does oftentimes break out.</p>
            <p>It were long to tell you of the maniſold, not onely unexpected unkindneſſes, but very injurious contumelies which from this fountaine have flowed out upon our whole Nation; all which we have entertained with ſo great wiſdome and meekneſſe, as the Lord did furniſh; ſo much the rather that we did find this folly and unjustice as much reſented by the wiſer of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men as we could have wiſhed: Beſide, that this generation of men have ſerved the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the Common-Counſell of <hi>London,</hi> the Houſes of Parliament, the Kings Majesty himſelfe, and whoſoever elſe lyes croſſe in their way, large as uncivilly as they have done us; the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions we have in our ſufferings, make our other wayes inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable injuries the more tolerable.</p>
            <p>But of all the kinds of injuſtice whereby they have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deal againſt us, this now in hand ſeems to be moſt ſtrange: they reſt not ſatisfied with all they are able of themſelves to ſpeak, write or print for the diſgrace of our Church, unleſſe they ſcrape together, and with their owne hands caſt upon our face the falſeſt of the moſt wicked calumnies which our common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the Prelats, either of old or of late have invented againſt us. We esteemed our ſelves ſecure of this kind of dealing from thoſe whom we knew to have ſolemnly ſworne the defence of our Church-Government againſt the common enemy: I profeſſe I cannot deny myamazement to ſee men who pretend to more then ordinary piety, fall upon their wel-deſerving Brethren ſo openly before the Sun in contempt of God and his ſolemn Oath, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force upon them old rotten calumnies, which cannot but fall back upon the head, not onely of the firſt Authors, but alſo with
<pb facs="tcp:135324:4"/>encreaſe of ſhame upon the face of the malicious repeaters ſo much againſt all piety, charity and wiſdome.</p>
            <p>You know that one of the moſt falſe and wicked pieces that of old was written againſt the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> was <hi>Adam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> Declaration in the yeer <hi>1584.</hi> it was ſo vile, that the Author was brought to an ingenuous confeſſion of the ſhamefull and wicked lyes, whereof it was full; King <hi>James</hi> at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time did diſclaime it under his hand, divers of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments did condemne the matter of it as erroneous and wrong: That pestiferous carcaſſe which with all poſſible infamy was buried ſo ſoon as borne, and did lye quiet in its grave of ſhame till a full Climaterick of three ſcore and three yeers; our good friends have been ſo wiſe for themſelves, and kind to us, as to dig up its ſtinking bones, and to carry it from houſe to houſe, from ſhire to ſhire over all <hi>England,</hi> and where over elſe a printed pamphlet can goe, ſerving their Brethren of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with this curteſie according to their Covenant.</p>
            <p>And leaſt the antick face of ſo long buried a body, ſhould not have been looked upon by the multitude with any content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they did choice to be at the coſt of putting it in a fine new <hi>Engliſh</hi> dreſſe, and ſetting upon its head the Cape of a royall title: All to draw the eyes of the vulgar upon it, who otherwiſe might have paſſed by it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h neglect and diſdaine. In this they have put themſelves to a peece of pains which I never knew or heard uſed with any other book: they do print it firſt in Master <hi>Adamſons</hi> owne old <hi>Scottiſh</hi> language, and thereafter tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated it in good moderne <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſetting before both the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of A Declaration made by King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Church-government and Presbyters. When all this was told us, we made our addreſſe to the worſhipfull Lycenſer, intreating that a Pamphlet ſo extreamly injurious to our whol Church and Nation, might be ſmothered upon the Preſſe, and returned to its pit where ſo long it had lyen in infamy;
<pb facs="tcp:135324:5"/>we were told by him that divers perſons of eminency, at leaſt for their place and preſent Station <hi>had ſtrongly moved him with great importunity</hi> to give his Licenſe for its reprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Yet that upon our ſo juſt and reaſonable deſires he would doe his beſt to ſtop it: hereupon we rested ſatisfied, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of its ſuppreſſion; notwithstanding, within two dayes after this promiſe it came abroad, the importunity and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the perſons who had drawne from the Licenſer his <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primatur,</hi> with greater eaſe did draw from the Preſſe ſome thouſands of the printed Copies, and made them to be ſold pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, to our ſmall contentment.</p>
            <p>While this not very pleaſant morſell is lying in our ſtomack ſcarce halfe digested, behold a ſecond diſh is preſented to us for to helpe our concoction of the firſt; Master <hi>Jo. Maxwell,</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> Excommunicate by our generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, declared Incendiary by our Parliament, and made unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable in the Propoſitions of Peace; did write in the gall of his bitterneſſe a wicked Satyre againſt all the parts of the Government of our Church. This ſome three yeeres agoe the Author did print at <hi>Oxford,</hi> under the Title of an Anſwer by Letter, ſhewing how inconſistent Presbyteriall government is with Monarchy. The Cavaliers there received it with great joy, being extreamly ſatisfactory to their ſpight and revengefull humour againſt <hi>Scotland,</hi> which they did ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily damne and curſe, as the firſt and greateſt Fountaine of all their woes. In this the Lord gave teſtimony for us againſt them; for by a ſudden and unexpected fire almoſt all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of that wicked Booke were deſtroyed before they were brought from the Printers Shoppe, by the ſtrange and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able accident, the mouth of the Author, and of his malignant friends at <hi>Oxford</hi> were ſo ſtopped, that we heard very little more of that Booke from them. But behold our Covenanting Brethren at <hi>London,</hi> I meane ſome of our Antipresbyterian
<pb facs="tcp:135324:5"/>friends, tooke the courage and charity to plucke out of the fire the remainder of the Prelats labours, and miſregarding not onely the ſentence of men, the Acts of the generall Aſſembly of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of the Parliaments of both Kingdomes, making the man an excommunicate and unpardonable Incendiary; but alſo the judgement of God from Heaven, who to their knowledge, had burnt the moſt of that Impreſſion to aſhes, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they will gather what was left out of the fire as a holy relict, and hug it in their boſome, till by a new Impreſſion at <hi>London</hi> of ſome thouſand copies, they be enabled to make it run over all the Kingdome, and ſo much farther as a Pamphlet hugely cryed up by their voices could flee. Our diligence to ſearch and find out the Preſſe, the Licenſer, and if we had pleaſed, the Solicitors of their former Writ, made them a little more cautious in the reprinting and publiſhing of this; but for all their warineſſe it was viſible enough, by whoſe industry the Books were disperſed to the Members of Parliament, and over all the City; it was knowne, by whoſe ſerious recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, wings were ſet to the ſides of that Fowle, that it might flee with all diligence, much farther and more quickly then the art and malice of the Malignants at <hi>Oxford</hi> were able to have carried it.</p>
            <p>For my part, all the revenge I wiſh of ſo grievous a wrong, all the penance I would put upon the Authors and Actors therein, beſide the weight of that ſin and ſhame which they have drawne upon themſelves by ſpreading ſo falſe and ſo wicked lyes of them who by ſolemne oath they were obliged to have defended againſt ſuch injuries, ſhall be onely to collation at their conveniency, my ſubſequent Anſwer with their owne beloved Writs; when they have compared page with page, if they find not a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory reply to every materiall paſſage, then with my good leave let them rejoyce in their work, and goe on to recommend to more hands the ſerious peruſall of theſe two notable peices; but if ſo
<pb facs="tcp:135324:6"/>it fall out that they find it demonstrate to their owne hearts ſatisfaction, that theſe imputations whereby they esteemed the honour of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Preſbytery to be moſt grievouſly and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably wounded, to be nothing but moſt impudent calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, then I truſt they will be entreated to repent of their raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and hereafter to be more ſlow in publiſhing or recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding infamous Libels againſt Nations and Churches (to whom justice, though piety and charity had both been loſt, did oblige them to be friendly) before they have tryed from ſome who can informe what truth may be in theſe things, which onely enemies in the heat of their rage and revenge of ſuppoſed and miſ-ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended wrongs, have invented and spread.</p>
            <p>It had indeed been convenient that this Anſwer had come ſooner abroad, and followed the lyars cloſer at the heels, but the delay was none of my fault: The Work for ſome time was in another far fitter hand, when neceſſary diverſions had hindred it there to be ſo much as begun, and I was called unto it before I could purchaſe and caſt over a good many Writs whereupon my diſcourſe was neceſſarily to be grounded, time did ſlide over: &amp; when I came to be ready, I found the Preſſe ſo much in work, or the work-men in idleneſſe, that I was much diſ-appointed of my hopes of ſo quick a dispatch as ſometimes I have found; but if what I have done be well, it will not I hope come ſo late as to be quite out of ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>I may confeſſe to you, to whom I was wont to communicate the greateſt of my ſecrets, that although at the beginning I was much averſe from medling at all with this taske, yet when once I entred upon it, it became to me a very pleaſant labour not onely in regard of the pregnant occaſion it put in my hand to make the lyes and malice of the malignants, the impudence and raſhneſſe of the Sectaries againſt us cleere as the noon day, but specially for the opportunity which divine providence did offer ſo faire as I could have wiſhed, of bringing to light before
<pb facs="tcp:135324:6"/>the whole Iſle the oppreſſed innocency of many moſt precious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who had been halfe martyred in <hi>Scotland</hi> and lay ſtill buried too much in oblivion under their ſufferings: alſo of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying the miſ-apprehenſions which the Prelaticall party had bred in many well meaning minds both in this Iſle and over Sea by their groſſe miſ-repreſentations of all the oppoſition which in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> had heen made to their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous oppreſſions. I was glad to be drawn by unadviſedneſſe of adverſaries, to let the world know the plaine truth of that <hi>17.</hi> day of <hi>December,</hi> of the Aſsembly at <hi>Aberdeen 1505.</hi> of the tumult at <hi>Edinborough 1637.</hi> and of many more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſsages of our Eccleſiastick History, which the Prelats during their Reigne, and lately alſo in their rage for their ruine, were wont to ſet out in no other habit then of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous tragedies.</p>
            <p>I was alſo glad of this nick of time when the Preſbyteriall Government was comming to be ſet up over all <hi>England,</hi> and when a little ſtumbling-block was apt to make many fall, to be put to the cleering of a number of practicall paſſages in all the parts of that government, wherein the experience of <hi>Scotland</hi> cannot but give light to all who will follow, not them ſo much as the Word of God, and ſound reaſon which firſt led them into their way of Preſbytery, and ſtill has kept them therein not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of all the fraud, of all the force which the Court and clergy has imployed ſometime to cheat, ſometime to beat them out of that path.</p>
            <p>It was to me a pleaſant ſervice, and abundantly recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of it ſelfe to open the priſons wherein the unjustice of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats had too too long incloſed the names and reputations of the moſt gracious instruments in our Church, condemning them ſo far as was in their power to lye in darkneſſe and ſtink unto the worlds end. I was not a little glad to be imployed in bringing forth and uſhering up to the ſtage of this vaſt theater where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb facs="tcp:135324:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>now we ſtand, thoſe great and noble names of <hi>John Knox, John Willock, Andrew</hi> and <hi>James Melvils, Robert Bruce John Welſh, Thomas Smeiton, Iames Lauſon, David Black,</hi> and divers others, from whoſe ſaces a great light does ſhine, and from their fame a moſt fragrant odour for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of all that comes neer them, whoſe ſenſes are not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very dull, or much corrupted. I was alſo content with another part of my taske, to throw downe to the duſt of juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and wel-deſerved diſgrace, the unhappy and infamous wretches <hi>Adamſon, Spotſwood, Maxwell, Balcanquell</hi> and others, who by the ſteps of very evill actions and great diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to their mother Church and Country, had all of them at leaſt in hope, perked themſelves up upon the pinacles of the higheſt honours both of our Church and State, that in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of God, whom they had greatly provoked, they might be tumbled downe into the more fearfull and exemplary pits of ruine.</p>
            <p>Many of theſe ſtories I learned from your loving and kind diſcourſe in my very childhood; of late I have endeavored to my power to encreaſe and make certaine that part of my knowledge by ſearching the chiefe Fountaines thereof as I had opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for all that I ſay in my anſwer, I beleeve if I be put to it, I can give good enough authorities, and if any more be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be ſaid, if I were beſide you, and that living magazine of our whole Eccleſiastick History, moſt Reverend Master <hi>Catherwood,</hi> I know whence I ſhould be abundantly furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; however, what here I ſubjoine out of the little ſtore I had at hand, I ſubmit it to your judgement, and reſt</p>

            <p>In theſe actions the <hi>Scots</hi> did ſpend very much precious blood, many of them did endure much hardſhip both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and at home by the Peſtilence; by a prevailing Enemy, by inteſtine diſcouragements and diviſions, all flowing from their friendſhip with <hi>England,</hi> they were overwhelmed with greater miſeries then their fathers had ſeen for many hundred yeares, and which grieved them more then all things elſe, they were entertained by too many of them for whom they ſuffered all theſe evills with ſo great unkindneſſe, they were loadned with ſo many calumnious and contumelious aſperſions, the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion their greateſt aime went ſo farre back before their eyes, that their provocations were great, to provide at laſt for themſelves while ſomething yet at home did remain to them to be preſerved. But beholding viſibly in their retreat and proviſion for themſelves, the certain ruine of their unadviſed friends, they chuſed rather to put up with patience all their ſufferings and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to wait on till the ruine of the Enemy, and ſetling of their brethrens eſtate by their help, might open the eyes of all, and bring the moſt perverſe to Repentance for their misbehaviour towards the inſtruments of their welfare; eſpecially when they did ſee the invincible fidelity of the <hi>Scots</hi> unbrangled with the greateſt temptations.</p>
            <p>Though in all their late unexpreſſible extremities they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no aſſiſtance at all from <hi>England,</hi> nor much importuned them for it, though to their greateſt griefe they did ſee the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gren of Hereſie and Schiſme without the application of any true remedy, overſpreading all <hi>England</hi> ſo faſt, that the infection of <hi>Scotland</hi> with this Peſtilence ſeemed unavoidable, though the current of affaires did ſeem to run in that channell, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and family of the King, the authority of the Parliament, the Liberties of the City and Kingdome might be caſt ere long into no mall hazard; our Army alſo and Nation for no other cauſe but their conſtant reſolutions to keep to their firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, did ſeem to ſtand in a very neer poſſibility to be to ally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; yet for all this they were farre from any raſh or unjuſt concluſion, their eyes were towards the Lord, they did wait for his deliverance, and when by him an opportunity was put in their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:135324:14"/>hands to right themſelves with the diſadvantage of others, yet they did mannage that occaſion with ſo much juſtice, wiſedome, dexterity and ſucceſſe, that all the world they hope is ſatisfied with their honeſty, as of men who minded nothing more then the ſaving of the whole Iſle from theſe calamities that viſibly were imminent; the re-eſtabliſhing of the King in his throne, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of the Parliament, City, and Country in all their rights, the ſetling of Religion and peace according to the word of God, and the Lawes of the Land, and their owne quick returne to their homes in very eaſie and equitable termes, enriched with nothing ſo much a with a conſcience of well deſerving, with the bleſſings of all <hi>England,</hi> with the commendation of Neighbour nations, and with the hopes of the Poſterities favourable conſtruction of their whole deportment in this great action.

            <p>In the laſt two Sections of the Preface,

            <p>What is ſpoken of the Authors Gravity and Learning, wee ſhall take it as we find it, he is as others of the faction for learning, neither with the firſt nor with the laſt, but for effront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boldneſſe he is ſecond I dare ſay to none of them all; as for piety none that ever knew him young or old, will ſweare him guilty of any ſuch imputation. That he was an eye witneſſe of the Stories he relates is evidently falfe, for all except a very few of his Relations, are of things paſt before his birth, at leaſt before the yeares of his diſcretion, and what he reports of our late troubles he did not ſee, for then was he buſie executing <hi>Canterburies</hi> commands in his Dioceſſe of <hi>Roſſe,</hi> an out corner of our Kingdome, and ſo ſoon as that ſtorme began to blow a little loud, he quickly fled out of the Land, whither he never yet returned, being conſcious of his deſervings, for of all the <hi>Scots</hi> Clergy, he alone was declared Incendiary, and him only did the juſtice of the Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> appoint to tread in the laſt footſteps of <hi>William Laud,</hi> as he had done in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer with great joy.</p>

            <p>In the Treatiſe it ſelfe you draw your diſcourſe to foure heads, the Church Seſſion or Congregationall Elderſhip, the Claſſicall <hi>Presbytery,</hi> Provinciall Synod, and generall Aſſembly, upon ſome of theſe foure you draw in what ever diſgracefull Story you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135324:16"/>have either heard or read of any Churchmen of <hi>Scotland</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to your way. The great fountaine of all your bitter waters, is that ciſtern which <hi>Spotſwood</hi> of St <hi>Andrewes</hi> did endeavour all his life time to gather together; in that Collection the Authors great intention was to heap up all things he conceived might make the Presbyteriall Government hatefull, and the Epiſcopall lovely; but being certain of great contradiction from many who knew as much in affairs as himſelfe, and were much more willing to ſpeak truth without diſguiſe, he kept in this book while he lived, that it might not ſee the light till after his death, when he was not to be argued with for any of his lying and malicious Narrations. This Manuſcript falling in your hands, you draw out of it what is moſt venemous, and or that ſtuffe make up this preſent booke. There are long agoe in <hi>Scotland</hi> prepared, ſufficient Antidotes againſt the poiſon of the whole ſtory, wherby any man may be furniſhed without difficulty towards the full confutation of your extracts; but the groſſeneſſe of your Lyes did cry ſo loud at this time for an anſwer, that the patience of many good people admitted not of ſo long a delay as that I could be furniſhed from a far with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny materials; yet out of the ſmall ſtore of my knowledge and memory of the affaires you ſpeake of, and by ſome few helps which my preſent accomodations doe furniſh, I will venture to give you a ſudden anſwer, which I hope ſhall prove ſatisfactory enough to all ingenuous Readers, who will not affect to cavill, if there ſhall be found any materiall defect, reply when you will, you ſhall have a rejoynder.</p>
            <p>Upon your firſt head of Church Seſſions you ſpend your firſt three pages, wherein you make us aſcribe to our Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Elderſhips much undue and tyrannick power.
<note place="margin">Page 1. The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> gives no more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhips then both the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents and Eraſtians doe allow.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer in generall; Firſt, That we give no more power to congregationall Elderſhips then the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> aſcribe to them, both in their doctrine and daily practiſe. Secondly, the power we aſcribe to them cannot be challenged either by Independents or <hi>Eraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> for the Independents great plea with us, is about the defect, that we give not power enough to that Court, with our exceſſe herein they were never offended; as for the <hi>Eraſtians</hi> they will not queſtion with us about any power which the Parliament will be pleaſed to allow unto that Elderſhip; now your ſelfe doth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135324:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>know that our Church Seſſions practiſe not any power, but that which the Acts of our Parliament do warrant, our liberty there is not aſtricted to any certaine enumerate caſes, but I dare ſay that in many yeares we will not have occaſion in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationall Elderſhips to meddle in any caſe; which even this Parliament hath not already allowed, or will not (as I conceive) be willing upon the firſt Emergency to allow.</p>
            <p>I grant you Prelates are here our oppoſites,
<note place="margin">The ground of the Prelates quarrell is abſurd.</note> but how juſtly, let equitable men judge; you tell us that congregationall Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips ought to have no power at all, becauſe forſooth, the whole power of all ſpirituall juriſdiction, muſt reſide in the Biſhop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: It is your principle that in all the Preachers and in all the Congregations of the whole Dioceſſe yea of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, there is not ſo much power as to give to any man for what ever crime, a publike admonition; yet any Lay man in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or out of the Kingdom, whom the Biſhop is pleaſed to make his Officiall or Chancellor, may keep a Court in any part of the Dioceſſe, and therein paſſe a ſentence of Excommunication a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the beſt Paſtors and chiefe Members of any Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe the Scots ſince their firſt Reformation could never by any Art, nor by any Force, be gotten inſlaved to ſuch a Tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; therefore it is, that you, your Colleagues, and your Fathers, have been offended with them, and in your anger have inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe calumnies which here you are pleaſed to object.</p>
            <p>The firſt particular crime which ye lay to our charge is,
<note place="margin">The Prelates give much more Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall power to Laymen, then we to ruling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lders</note> That we doe give ſome power of ſpirituall juriſdiction to ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and that by a Divine Right; We grant the charge, and thinke it eaſie to demonſtrate the warrant of our Tenet both from Scripture, and the practiſe of all the ancient, and all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches; but it is needleſſe here to digreſſe into that debate, for this is not your maine quarrell with us that we give ſome power or juriſdiction to thoſe you call Lay-Elders, but that we aſcribe any part of juriſdiction to any at all beſide the Biſhop, for you know it is an Article of the Prelaticall Creed, That a preaching Elder hath no more intereſt in juriſdiction then a lay Elder, that for this kinde of power, Prieſt and people are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; That neither of them of themſelves by vertue of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice have any dram thereof, yet by vertue of a Commiſſion from the Biſhop either of them is capable of a pleni-potency, and are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135324:17"/>able to doe the acts of the higheſt ſpirituall juriſdiction; what the Ieſuites were wont to aſcribe unto the Pope in the Church univerſall, That the Biſhop takes to himſelf in his own Dioceſſe: he, and he alone, by Divine right, is the head, the ſun, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the onely receptacle of all ſpirituall jurisdiction which he keeps to himſelfe, or communicates to be execute by others; for the time, the meaſure, the perſons, according to his own good pleaſure. The Eraſtian principle is only different in this, that they pull the Pope and the Biſhop out of the chaire, that there may be roome to ſet downe the Magiſtrate in their place.</p>
            <p>What you ſpeak of the Deacons, it is a miſtake;
<note place="margin">We grant to Deacons no power of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdicton, we wiſh there were Doctors in populous congregations page 2. In ſome few congregations Elders have a diſpenſation for a time.</note> for albeit they be preſent in the Elderſhip to receive their directions for the poore, yet they doe not voice in any well governed Elderſhip, nor do they claime any power in juriſdiction: Concerning Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that populous Congregations <hi>wants them,</hi> it comes not from any deſigne, but for want either of meanes or of Idoneous and willing perſons.</p>
            <p>What you ſpeake of the yearely election of Elders, the matter is this; There is not in any Congregation of <hi>Scotland</hi> which I doe know, a yearly election of Elders, but in populous Cities, where the Elders are many and diverſe of them unable to attend that charge, without the hurt of their eſtate, the moſt of them being Merchants and Tradeſmen, who muſt travell for their livelyhood; they have a liberty to be free from that ſervice every two yeere, if ſo they be content to attend upon a call every third yeere, the Levites attended the ſervice of the Temple but a few months in the yeare: What is right or wrong in this cuſtome of ſome few of our Congregations, we are willing to debate it, and as it ſhall be found juſt or unjuſt, to keep or change that practiſe, for in ſuch things we love not to be contentious.</p>
            <p>In your three laſt Sections yee do caſt upon the Elderſhip in hand, a rabble of incongruous practiſes;
<note place="margin">Page 3. No Elderſhip inflicts any ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment although the Magiſtrate in the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip doth ſo ſometimes.</note> what you bring of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary mulcts, impriſonments, baniſhments, jogges, cutting of haire, and ſuch like, it becomes neither you to charge, nor us to be charged with any ſuch matters: No Church-aſſembly in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> aſſumes the leaſt degree of power, to inflict the ſmalleſt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill puniſhment upon any perſon; the Generall Aſſembly it ſelfe bath no power to fine any creature ſo much as in one groat: It is true, the Lawes of the Land, appoint <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eriour Magiſtrates in Burroughs or Shires, or of others to whom the Counſel Table gives a ſpeciall Commiſſion for that end; ordinarily ſome of theſe civill perſons are ruling Elders, and ſit with the Elderſhip: So when the Elderſhip have cognoſced upon the ſcandall alone of criminall perſons, and have uſed their ſpirituall cenſures only to bring the party to Repentance, ſome of the Ruling Elders, by vertue of their civill office or commiſſion will impoſe a Mulct, or ſend to Priſon or ſtocks or baniſh out of the bounds of ſome little circuit, according as the Acts of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament or counſell do appoint it. But that the Elderſhip ſhould imploy its Ecccleſiaſtick and Spirituall power for any ſuch end, none of us doe defend. That either in <hi>Scotland</hi> or any where elſe in the world, the haire of any perſon is commanded to be cut by any Church judicatory for diſgrace and puniſhment, is (as I take it) but a fooliſh fable. That any perſon truely penitent is threatned in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with Church cenſures for non-payment of Monies, is in the former Category of calumnies.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that all your alleagations were true,
<note place="margin">Biſhops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and civill office.</note> yet how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruouſly does a challenge of this kind come from your mouth? do you think that all civill imployments are incompatible with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall offices? How many Miniſters did you get to be Iuſtices of Peace? you your ſelfe were a judge of Common-pleas; your col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> was Chancellor of the Kingdom; you know the Treaſurers white ſtaffe was very neer to your hands, and for the miſſing of it what ſtir you made: Many of you were Lords of Councel, and all of you Lords both of Parliament, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Lordſhips and Regalities, where your Baylies kept Court in your names, diverſe of your Coat with your good liking, have been Secretaries of State, Keepers of the Privy Seale, Leger Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors with forraign Princes: your brethren over Sea in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine, Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> are Admirals of Royall Navies, are Generals of Land forces, are Princes of Temporall Eſtates, according to theſe principles that I thinke you doe approve, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Cannons in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and your ordinary practiſe in <hi>England.</hi> Great ſummes of mony were exacted in your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Courts, and pocketed up for private uſes; how many have been excommunicate there, for non-payment of a ſhilling, and refuſed abſolution, till their fine was payed with increaſe? what
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:135324:18"/>do you ſpeak to us of a pecuniary mulct, of a very ſmall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable value taken up by the Magiſtrate, and imployed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in pious uſes? Why doe you ſpeak to us of cutting of Beards, when your Prelates doe burne the cheeks; how many gracious ſoules have been ſtarved to death in your Epiſcopall dungeous? how many thouſands have you baniſhed out of Bricaine, out of <hi>Europe,</hi> for no fault at all but their zeale to the truth of God? how many hundred thouſand hath your pride and obſtinacy in error, cauſed to be ſlaine within theſe ſeven yeares; in the next age ignorant men may be pardoned to deny theſe things, but it were great impudence this day to deny them, when yet we do ſticke in the Pit of theſe troubles, wherein the madneſſe of you Prelates hath caſt us.</p>
            <p>Your objection about the <hi>Baptiſme of Baſtards</hi> is vain;
<note place="margin">We refuſe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant where either of the Parents will undertake for Chriſtian edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> for we refuſe not that Sacrament to any of them, if either of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents profeſie Repentance, and undertake for the Chriſtian edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their child, but the ground of your quarrelling in this Point is, that we cannot follow your Popiſh Doctrine, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute to profeſſe the actuall regeneration of all baptized Infants, and that we dare not put all unbaptized perſons in the ſtate of unregeneration and damnation.</p>
            <p>Your next head concerns the Claſſicall Presbytery;
<note place="margin">Page 4, 5. No Prince pleads for any exemption from Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</note> your firſt Objection againſt it, which a little thereafter, and oft elſewhere you do ingeminate, is, That the King and his family are ſubject to its Jurisdiction: I would gladly know if among the reſt of the Prelaticall abſurd ties this were one: That Chriſtian Princes and Magiſtrates are fully exempted from all Eccleſiaſtick juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; ſometimes your party would ſeem to ſpeake ſo, as if every Magiſtrate, at leaſt every Prince were ſuch a God upon earth that none might ſay to any of them, Sir, what are you doing, though they were running to hell themſelves, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at their heels, all they were able: This is ſo groſſe a flattery, that all adviſed Princes abhorre it, and confeſſe themſelves to be ſubject to Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline as well as others; for they know if they ſhould exempt themſelves from this part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian religion, they ſhould preſently be in hazard or looſing the benefit of all the reſt; for Chriſtianity is a body of Articles ſo ſtraitly joyned, that either all muſt be received or none.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:135324:19"/>do confeſſe ſo much as any Presbyterian in the world did ever thinke of: you ſay that the Crowne and Scepter is ſubject, not only to the directive power of the Church (expound the Church as you will, for a Congregationall Claſſicall or Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Elderſhip, it is alike for the preſent Queſtion) but alſo to the authoritative power of the ſame whereby the Church does proceed not onely <hi>in foro interiori conſcientsae</hi> but alſo <hi>exteriori <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus far you and the moſt Monarchik of the Prelates goe;
<note place="margin">No Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry did ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſ with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</note> that in doctrine any Presbyterian Divine went ever further, I doe not know, but in practiſe never one of them went ſo far: Some Biſhops have actually excommunicate the beſt of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours upon their enormous Scandalls; but that any Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian did ever ſo much as begin a proceſſe with any Prince, when they had the greateſt provocations thereto, it cannot be ſhewed to this day.

The Church of <hi>France</hi> alwaies wholly Presbyterian, when <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth one of their Members apoſtatiſed from them to the Pope, did never ſo much as enter into a conſultation of delivering him into the hands of Satan. Without all peradventure, Presbyterians are much more tender then any other Chriſtians of what ever name, to meddle with Magiſtrates by the cenſures of the Church.</p>
            <p>In the next Paragraph you flee out againe upon the ruling Elders, as if it were abſurd for any of their coat to ſit in Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Judicatories; all the ground of your quarrell is, their want of an Epiſcopall Commiſſion; with this qualification you can admit any Lay-man not onely to ſit in Eccleſiaſticall Iudicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but to ſit there as ſole and onely judge; you can make them your Vicar generalls before whom all the Clergy of your Dioceſſe muſt ſtand to be examined and judged, for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their duty in all Eccleſiaſtick adminiſtrations.

            <p>The beſt Princes are not void of Errours, the greateſt miſtake of this wiſe Prince was in his too great affection towards Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,

Had it been the will of God, that this, otherwiſe very wiſe Prince, at his firſt comming into <hi>England</hi> had caſt over the hedge of that Church, the evill weed of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and their Ceremonies, he had certainly procured much greater peace to his own minde, and in all probability prevented the huge miſchiefes which from this neglect above all other cauſes doe this day overwhelme his houſe and all his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>What here you ſubjoyn to prove the pride of the Presbytery and the ſtate it kept with King <hi>Iames,</hi> is an ill conceived bob;

            <p>The next Tale you tell us is,

            <p>What is ſubjoynd of the Presbyteries medling with Trade and commerce, of diſchargeing men to perſue for their debts,
<note place="margin">Page 9, 10.

            <p>The ſame I ſay of your next ſtory;
<note place="margin">They never took upon them to change a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket day.</note> the Munday markets in ſome chiefe Towns were an evident occaſion of prophaning the Lords holy Sabbath; this to all the godly was a matter of griefe; both particular perſons, and whole Presbyteries have oft regrated it, and offered their Petitions to the Councel and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for the remedying thereof; but that they ever of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did attempt to make any change of Market dayes, it is ſo falſe as any thing can be; you our Prelates as you were taught by your Fathers in <hi>England</hi> were alwaies paſſionately deſirous to have Sunday counted no Sabbath, both by your doctrine and example, you laboured to ſeduce the people to prophane that day with all kinde of publike paſtimes, all ſtrictneſſe about the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath you cryed downe, as Puritanick <hi>Iudaiſme,</hi> ſo long as your
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:135324:22"/>Kingdome ſtood, this evill was remedileſſe; but ſo ſoon as we got your chaires and thrones as you call them overturned, the firſt Generall Aſſembly thereafter made it one of their chiefe cares to cauſe draw a humble petition to the next enſuing Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for tranſlating of the Markets of the cheife Burroughs from <hi>Munday</hi> to <hi>Wedneſday:</hi> The Parliament being purged of Epiſcopall, Popiſh and Malignant Members, who oft before had obſtructed this gracious worke, unanimouſly did agree to the Petition; ſo that now, bleſſed be God, with the good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of all, and to the prejudice of none, theſe market dayes are changed.</p>
            <p>What follows of the Presbyteries violent tranſporting of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters from better places to worſe at the pleaſure of Noblemen,
<note place="margin">Nor to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Miniſters at any mans pleaſure.</note> I have known this done by Biſhops and their High Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (for no men ever in <hi>Scotland</hi> did ſo much flatter the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and aſſiſt them, if they were reſolved to oppreſſe a Miniſter, as the Prelates) but while the Presbyteriall government had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vigour, that every man was in this faſhion tranſported, I take it to be exceeding falſe; for by the Laws and practiſe of the Presbyrery, diſgracefull Tranſportations are of ſo great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that ſince the Biſhops were caſt out from among us, I did never hear of any; for no man with us can be put from a better place to a worſe but for a fault, which as it puts him from one place, ſo readily it will keep him from all others.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:135324:22"/>of diminiſhing your reputation with your great Patron <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> I am ſure your Colleague <hi>Spotſwood</hi> did ſell the whole Abacy of <hi>Killwinning</hi> to the Noblemen and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>Cuningham,</hi> to the great prejudice and griefe of the Univerſity of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and the Miniſters of the bounds who had great intereſt therein.</p>
            <p>At the Parliament of <hi>Lithgow</hi> 1606. our good Biſhops for their owne baſe ends did conſent in the name of the Church, though they had never ſo much as conſulted here in that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to the greateſt dilapidation that ever was heard of in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the impropriation to Noblemen and Gentlemen at one time, of no fewer then ſixteen Abbacies, every one whereof had incorporate the rents of a number of Pariſh Churches. Too many pranks of this kinde have been plaid by the Prelates and Clergy men of their way, but that ever any Presbytery was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch ſacrilegious tricks, it will never as I imagine be proved.</p>
            <p>What you ſpeake of a Gentlemans confeſſion in Teſtament of his griefe, for deceiving good Miniſters, is to no purpoſe;
<note place="margin">Page 12. Nor favour Gentlemen in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> did not Hypocrites deceive the Apoſtles? but that Miniſters did keep him from Church cenſures for his knowne unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, you know there is no reaſon to beleeve you upon your bare word; the Gentlemans hypocriſie was but ſmall, if his vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies were ſo open that juſtly he could be challenged for them.</p>
            <p>For your laſt imputation I know that feuds in <hi>Scotland</hi> were frequent and lamentable;
<note place="margin">They never did counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance any feud; all theſe were the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates crimes.</note> alſo that King <hi>Iames</hi> labours in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing them were happy and ſucceſſefull; but that any Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery did ever entertain them, its a lye ſo groſſe that for all your Cretian Art, you are not able to bring ſo much as the colour of on inſtance to prove it. I finde in <hi>Spotswood,</hi> Letters of King <hi>Iames</hi> to Presbyteries and Synods for their aſſiſtance in that gracious work; and it is certaine that all the Kings in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome had never been able to have aboliſhed theſe feuds with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the helpe of the Miniſtry. Can you tell me of any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that either did endeavour or had ſuch power in the heart of any people, as to promove that work one haires breadth? I know that the chiefe Biſhops for all their open fauning, were yet ever eſteemed ſo great haters of the Nobility and prime Gentry, that they did little regard how many of them peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:135324:23"/>your ſelfe I think knowes that in the feud betwixt the <hi>Grahams</hi> and the <hi>Sandilands,</hi> none was a better ſwordman, then your Metropolitan <hi>Spotswood.</hi>

            <p>Your laſt Paragraph is but a recapitulation of theſe things which I hope I have demonſtrate to be cleer untruths.</p>

That the moſt eminent men among us could ever carry an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly after them, farther then their reaſon did perſwade the minds of their Brethren, it is very untrue.</p>
            <p>How little able Noblemen have been to ſway the Votes of a Synod to their owne deſires, you and your Brethren know as well as any others: for the difficulty and impoſſibility of this practiſe was the maine ground whereupon your Antichriſtian order behoved to be brought back again from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Scotland:</hi> When King <hi>Iames</hi> by many experiments, had found that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himſelfe nor all the Noblemen of the Land were able ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Art, or allurements, or terrors to ſway the Aſſemblies
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135324:23"/>of the Church to their owne appetites, the reſolution was taken to deſtroy theſe meetings, to overturne their orders, to ſpoile them of their power, to put all in the hand of Biſhops upon this confidence, wherein they were not deceived, that although they had found it impoſſible to make the multitude of the Miniſters ſo long as their Aſſemblies injoyed their old and juſt privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, obſequious to the will of the Court; Yet if once that order of Synods were overturned, and their power ſetled in the Biſhops hands, it would be an eaſie matter to make the whole Clergy very tractable and obnoxious. What therefore here you object of the Synods ſerving the luſts of great men, was neither true nor poſſible, ſo long as the Presbyteriall government ſtood intire; but ſo ſoon as that was overthrowne and changed into Epiſcopacy, that game was gained. We never knew any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop oppoſe himſelf in any thing to the Court, nor to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of any Nobleman how unreaſonable ſo ever, if the Court was for him.</p>
            <p>What here you ſubjoyn of the great honour deferred to ſome of the Miniſtry,
<note place="margin">Page 14.

It is true, Miniſters of the Epiſcopall cut were no more prized then their Maſters; but this I may affirme that the pooreſt and weakeſt Miniſter of what ever ſide, was ever more honoured by the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Scotland</hi> then by the beſt of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, even thoſe who made it their glory to be the Patrons of poor Miniſters againſt the Nobilities oppreſſion. Though our Scottiſh Biſhops were not come to the height of the Engliſh Prelates grandour; and the pooreſt of the <hi>Scots</hi> Miniſters that ever I knew, were of a much better faſhion then many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of the Engliſh Curates and Prieſts; yet I have often ſeen the meaneſt of the Scottiſh preachers get more reſpect from the prime <hi>Earles</hi> of that Land, then the chiefe and beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:135324:24"/>Miniſters could have from their ordinary Biſhops, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within their private walls or in the face of their Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meetings. So what you object of the contempt of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if it be underſtood from their Brethren or from the Nobility or Gentry, it is very falſe; but if from you and your Colleagues it was too too viſible.</p>
            <p>Your next Storie concernes Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 15, 16, 17. Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> a gracious and Heroick Divine as <hi>Scotland</hi> ever bred. Though the quarrell of Epiſcopacy did at laſt alter King <hi>Iames</hi> countenance towards him, yet all the Biſhops of the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes had never ſo much reſpect from that Prince as this man. What you ſpeak of his great attendance, is either a very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or a very malicious miſtake; neither he nor any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Scotland,</hi> though nobly borne and of good Eſtates, uſed ever to be attended by any more ſervants then one at moſt, but in their journeying to Presbyteries, Synods or Viſitations, the Noblemen and Gentlemen members of theſe meetings, were alwaies glad of the Miniſters company, and when their way fell to be one, they were wont to travell together; doth it from hence follow, that the Noblemen and all the Gentlemen of their Traine, were the Miniſters attendants?</p>
            <p>The long relation you make of King <hi>Iames</hi> conference with Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> anent the Earle of <hi>Huntly,</hi> you take it out of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Spotswood,</hi> who at firſt was a domeſtick ſervant but ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after a great unfriend to Mr. <hi>Bruce;</hi> The tale of your Author you doe much enlarge, and adde unto it many circumſtances whereof you have no warrant; the matter as I gather it, out of your owne Author was thus. The Earle of <hi>Huntly</hi> all his life time was the head of the Popiſh faction in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he was oft excommunicate, and oft he gave ſatisfaction to the Church, abjuring his Popery, and joyning to our Church, but alwaies he plaid the Hypocrite or Apoſtate; when the Catholique league was firſt framed in <hi>France,</hi> betwixt the Pope, King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> and the <hi>Guizians</hi> for the rooting out of all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> this man made himſelfe quickly of that party: When in the eighty eight the Spaniſh Armada came to conquer this whole Iſle, no man was ſo ready as he with his whole ſtrength to have joyned with them, when after the miſcarriage of that Navy, the enterpriſe was renued, divers times he ſent his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:135324:24"/>to the Prince of <hi>Parme</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and to <hi>Philip</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> aſſuring his readineſſe to concurre for the deſtruction of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and all the Proteſtants in the Iſle; though all theſe horrible Treaſons were proved under his owne hand, and acknowledged, and all were pardoned, yet nothing could amend his evill nature, he was ſtill ſound plotting the delivery of the Iſle, into the Spaniards hands; and when all hope of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne invaſion was paſt, yet he could not give over, but was proved to have new plots upon the Kings perſon, for making of him priſoner, and killing before his face Chancellor <hi>Maitland,</hi> his prime and beſt Counſellour: This alſo was pardoned, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he remained the ſame man, and quickly thereafter in the ſight of the Court, and all the Town of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he burnt the Earle of <hi>Murrays</hi> houſe above his head, (<hi>Murray</hi> was a prime Noble man of the Land, the Kings neer Kinſman, the heire of the good Regent, the beſt Governour that any King of <hi>Scotland</hi> did ever injoy) this man did <hi>Huntly</hi> kill without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſe at all, but his owne meere envy and malice; for theſe crimes he was againe excommunicate; the Earle of <hi>Argile</hi> at the Kings intreaty and direction perſued him with an Army of ten thouſand men; many hundreds of theſe good ſubjects were killed by that Rebell, when after <hi>Argiles</hi> deſeat, the King himſelfe with his prime Nobles went out againſt him, he with diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed banner went to the fields againſt the King; all this <hi>Spotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> reports at length. Let any conſcientious man here be judge, King <hi>Iames</hi> for his owne reſpects requires a conſcientious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to conſent and concurre with him, to obtain from the next enſuing Aſſembly, the abſolution of ſuch a man from the cenſure of Excommunication, for this was the main queſtion; the honeſt Miniſter could not be perſwaded to conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the relaxation of ſuch a bloody obſtinate Apoſtate, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by all to be ſtill imponitent, from the cenſures either of Church or State: As for the inconveniences, his Majeſty did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the dangers from the Papiſts of <hi>England,</hi> if <hi>Huntly</hi> and the Popiſh party in <hi>Scotland</hi> were too much irritate; was it any great crime for Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> to differ in this from his Majeſty, and to tell him plainly that which was the opinion of all the good Miniſters of <hi>Scotland,</hi> though the ground of the Kings quarrell with them, That it would prove his beſt policy to make faſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:135324:25"/>with the Proteſtant party of <hi>England</hi> and over-ſea, renouncing all correſpondency either with Papiſts or Prelates, that if he walked upon this ground, God and his right would carry him through all, both ſeen and imagined difficulties? The world long agoe is ſatisfied with the wiſedome of this advice; for it was quickly found that too much connivence and compliance with Papiſts, did bring that Prince upon the very brinke of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; for the Popiſh party of <hi>England</hi> finding themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed of their great hopes did run to the deſperate attempts of the Powder-plot and other Treaſons: Alſo the keeping up of the Biſhops was a great cauſe of all the miſchiefes which ſince that time to this day have fallen either upon our Church or State; It is true, the words you aſcribe to Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> are very unmannerly; but who will beleeve that ever any ſuch phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes proceeded from the mouth of ſo grave and wiſe a man? your only Author is <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> His teſtimony in this caſe ought not to be truſted; but if you will looke to the matter of Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> his counſell, I ſubject it to the touchſtone of the ſevereſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers.</p>

            <p>The Generall Aſſembly in <hi>Scotland</hi> hath no more power then what the Parliaments ſince the firſt Reformation have heartily allowed unto them, they meddle with no temporall caſe at all;
<note place="margin">It exerciſes no power but what the King and the Laws authorize.</note> and all the ſpirituall caſes which to this day they have touched, may be reduced to a few heads: That every diſobedience brings with it Excommunication, is a wide ſlander, we doe not excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate but for a grievous tranſgreſſion joyned with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary obſtinacy; This cenſure is ſo rare with us, that a man may live long and before his death never be witneſſe to it.

            <p>You object it once and againe that the Commiſſioners of Burroughs and Univerſities are received as Members in our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſemblies; behold the greatneſſe of this crime,

You give him a power to call ſo many as he will, without all Commiſſion from any Church, to voice in all Aſſemblies, and by the multitude of their voices to carry all: You give him alſo a power to hinder the Aſſembly to debate any matter which he miſlikes, were it never ſo neceſſary for the very being of the Church: You give him a Negative Vote to ſtop any conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, were it never ſo conſonant to the Word of God; yea, an affirmative Vote to carry all things in the Aſſembly, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to his owne minde, The Aſſembly being but his Arbitrary Court in things ſpirituall, by whoſe advice the Prince who is the ſupream judge in all cauſes does determine as he findes it expedient; ſometimes according, ſometimes contrary to their judgement.

The matter whereof <hi>Iohn Knox</hi> is ſpeaking is this, The body of <hi>Scotland</hi> in the yeare 1557. were true and zealous Proteſtants, the Maſſe and Images were to them Idols: long before the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and protector of the Kingdom Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> was for the Religion, At his firſt Parliament he did authorize ſome good beginnings of Reformation, the Cardinall and Clergy at this grew mad, and found means to tranſlate the government from the Duke to the Queens Mother, ſiſter to the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi> and Cardinall of <hi>Lorain;</hi> in the time both of the Duke and Queen Mothers Regency, the cruelty of the Biſhops was unſufferable. They took divers of the moſt zealous Preachers and Profeſſors, men and women, and publikely without any Commiſſion from the Magiſtrate, onely for their zeale to the truth of God, did burne them quick as Hereticks: After many yeers patience, the people at laſt ſeeing no end of the Prelates fury, did cauſe write Letters to ſome of their moſt wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, telling them that if they gave not over to murther their Brethren, themſelves ſhould taſte of that Cup, of which they forced others to drink. All the Reformation which the people at that time practiſed, was to keep themſelves pure from moſt vile Idolatry, and in private to heare the Word of God purely preached: They made no publike Reformation till firſt they had openly ſupplicated the Queen and gotten her allowance, and a promiſe of an Act of Parliament in the yeare 1558. which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:135324:28"/>promiſe when the Proteſtant Nobility, Gentry and Commons did preſſe in face of Parliament, it was not denyed by the Queen, but cunningly put off, upon aſſurance that all their deſires at the firſt conveniency ſhould be granted: in the meane time ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Proteſtation for a Liberty to live in their reformed Churches ſeparate from Popiſh Idolaters, and promiſed in due time to give to the Proteſters full ſatisfaction.

They began to the terror of the whole Iſle, to fortifie <hi>Leith,</hi> and other Maritime places; they exerciſed an evident ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny both in Church and State, and overthrew the Laws and liberties of the Nation, which forced the cheiſe of the Nobility for the caſting off of this yoak of ſtavery from the Church and State, and preventing the danger which threatned the whole Iſle to enter in a covenant of defence both among themſelvs and with the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> but without the leaſt prejudice to the juſt authority of their Soveraign then Queen of <hi>France,</hi> as it after appeared: for when by the bleſſing of God and the helpe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:135324:28"/>of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they had ejected the French uſurpers, they did heartily receive and obey the Queen ſo ſoon as ſhe came from <hi>France.</hi> For the juſtification of all this I could bring formall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies out of <hi>Spotswood</hi> himſelfe.</p>
            <p>What you ſay of the depoſition of Queen Regent from her Authority, it is falſe that any Church Aſſembly did ever med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with it leſſe or more; it was the Act of the three Eſtates; how juſt let any judge. She was the firſt woman as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that ever in <hi>Britain</hi> had the government of the State; it belonged not to her by any right, the Lawes provided that charge for Duke <hi>Hamilton;</hi> but ſhe and the Prelates couzend him out of his right and long poſſeſſion; ſhe became not only a violent perſecuter of all the faithful againſt the Law and her own promiſes but alſo went about evidently by violence and force of Arms to ſubdue the land to the tyranny of ſtrangers: much of this ſhee did, albeit at the direction of her Brethren of <hi>Loraine,</hi> yet without all commiſſion from our Soveraigne her daughter. When no ſupplication nor remonſtrance could ſtop her, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the Land being all denounced Rebels, and Traitors by her, did paſſe an Act not for depriving her of her Regency, but for the ſuſpending of her Authority till the next Parliament; or till ſhee altered the courſe of her tyrannous government with an expreſſe proteſtation that the authority and power of the King and Queen of <hi>France</hi> their Soveraignes ſhould remain to them ſacred and inviolable.</p>
            <p>This act of the Statewhether right or wrong, what does it concerne the generall Aſſembly of the Church? be it ſo that a Miniſter or two being called for advice, did give their aſſent to this action which is the furtheſt our Enemies alledge, yet what hath this to doe with our Church government? it ſeems the conſcience of the Queen did approve of this ſentence againſt her; for ſhe did much repent of all thoſe actions which did procure it, as ſhe did evidence in that conference which a little before her death ſhe required and did obtain with the prime Proteſtant Nobles, and the Miniſter Mr. <hi>Willocks,</hi> whoſe hand in her ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion was alledged to be chiefe.

            <p>That abominable calumny which continually you fall upon, as if our doctrine did tend to the killing of Kings, demonſtrates the ſuperfluity of your naughty malice, whereby your fellowes
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:135324:29"/>and you above any one, were wont to poiſon the eares and heart of the King, while you were about him, till at laſt you did precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him in theſe dangers that very readily might have taken away from him both his life and his crowne. I deſire to know of you who charges us with this abominable crime of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kings who were the men that ſaved the life and authority of King <hi>Iames</hi> ſo long as he was in <hi>Scotland?</hi> and who be theſe who have preſerved King <hi>Charles</hi> from utter ruine, wherein your wicked companions and your ſelfe with the firſt, by your pernicious wayes did caſt him, and would hold him ſtill therein, if you might be heard?

Some few Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries and two or three Cathedrall Churches, were caſt down by the idle provocations of ſome Popiſh Prieſts, who were ſo mad upon their Idolatry that they would keep theſe places to be Caſtles and forts to preſerve and propagate their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; But quickly that fury of the Prieſts was gotten ſuppreſt and the Churches peaceably purged, ſo that I have not heard that in all our Land, above three or foure Churches were caſt down.</p>

<note place="margin">Page 17, 28.</note> I muſt touch but upon ſome of his principall paſſages: in his 27 page, he makes the Reformers to diſclaime Soveraign Authority, to denounce warre, to enter it to a covenant for mutuall defence, to command the Nobility to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:135324:29"/>joyne with them under the paine of excommunication, &amp;c. A waſpe out of the ſweeteſt hearbs ſucks venom, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as all our Hiſtorians relate, was this.</p>

They write a threatning Letter to the Biſhops and Prieſts, the great Incendiaries of the time, to kindle the Queenes wrath againſt her beſt Subjects: this you call denouncing of Warre. Some members of their owne Congregation did come with the Queen againſt them, namely the Earles of <hi>Argyle</hi> and <hi>Murrey,</hi> Them they intreated not to ſhed their Brethrens blood, otherwiſe they ſhewed them their deſerving to be excommunicate out of that ſociety, which without cauſe they did perſecute; The ſeaſonablenes of this reproofe did quickly appeare, both the Noblemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Loyalty of their Brethren and their unjuſt oppreſſion by others, did leave the Queene and joyne with the Proteſtant party.

            <p>Your long diſcourſe of the Generall Aſſemblies Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty above the King is cloſed with two other ſtories,
<note place="margin">

Your firſt gybe is, at the power of the Generall Aſſembly, which the King and Parliament has allowed unto it, and whereof they are in a quiet poſſeſſion: to wit, that in matters meerely Spirituall, they are the laſt ordinary Iudges: but if they ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, that the King and Parliament ſhould not have power to make them reforme their errours, it never came in any of our minds.

In your ſcoffe of a Scottiſh Pope the ſmoke of ignorance goes up, with the fire of malice: theſe many years, for your old ſtinging, you have bin removed to dark Cavernes, though ſometimes for a Breathing you have cropen out to <hi>Oxford</hi> &amp; <hi>Dublin:</hi> but had your crimes permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you to have walked a little, either at <hi>Lond.</hi> or <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> or any where in this Iſle, where the Sun of Truth &amp; Juſtice did ſhine, or any where over Sea, where the affaires of this Iſle with any ingenuity uſe to be repreſented: you would not have called that moſt gracious man a Pope. For how

            <p>But it is our firſt Reformation that chiefely grieves you,
<note place="margin">Our firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was authorized by Parliament.</note> you continually breake out upon that, and repeate very oft the ſame moſt bitter ſlanders. The reformation in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as has been ſaid, began long before the yeare 1558. when the Queens Mother was not yet come to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the yeare 1542. the Proteſtant Regent, Duke <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> with the conſent of Parliament did then authorize it, and ſet it on foot; albeit the compleat and publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the whole Land, was not till the yeare 1560. when the Parliament convened by the authority of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne, and after ratified by her, did authorize it fully. Her delay for a little to ratifie that Parliament makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt its validity, eſpecially ſince now for fourſcore and five yeares it has ſtood firme, as one of our moſt happy Parliaments, not queſtioned by any, but ſome few eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly malignant Papiſts, and Prelates.</p>
            <p>That which here you ſcorne in <hi>Knox,</hi> is a truth uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted by any reaſonable man: that Religion has its own proper intrinſecall ſtrength from God, its only Author; that Princes and ſtates may and ought as ſervants to God their Lord, make way for it in their Dominions by their good Lawes; but this does not adde any more internall truth and ſtrength to Religion then it has of it ſelfe, before the Magiſtrate confirmed it, and which it cannot loſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Magiſtrate doe cry it downe, and perſecute it for errour.</p>

In the year 1578.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:135324:33"/>it was all agreed unto in the Generall Aſſembly: Mr. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> was a gracious inſtrument in that worke, but all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the Kingdome did joyne with him therein. With the ſtates they had ſome controverſie, but not for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Government, in this the Harmony betwixt the Church and State was full, but for the Church Patrimony, wherein the King did joyne heartily with the Aſſembly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Court, and wherein your ſelfe cannot but beare witnes to the honeſty of the Divines at that time. For it was their mind that Church rents ought not to be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priat to Courtiers nor given to Prelats, nor ſerve the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and avarice of any Church-men, but ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the Honorable and comfortable maintenance of all that ſerved at the Altar, and for the reliefe of the poore and ſtrangers, and what was above, to go to the publicke u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ſtate. But in this gracious deſigne, the cunning firſt of the Court, and after of the Prelates, did Croſſe both the King and the Aſſembly, ſo that for peace they behoved to yeild, albeit upon occaſion both his Majeſty and the Church did often proteſt for their rights.
<note place="margin">The King and his Counſell did ſet up the Presbyteries over all the Land at the ſame time.</note>

            <p>But for any parts of the Presbiteriall Government which in that Booke of diſcipline was ſet downe, there was no controverſie in the year 1580 betwixt the Church and the Court: The privie counſell had ſubſcribed all that book with ſome reſervation about Church rents; the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſemblies oft did agree to it without any exception, his Majeſtie himſelfe in the fore named year did ſend to the Aſſembly with an expreſſe commiſſioner the platform of all the Presbiteries, which therafter were erected over all <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp; which againſt all the Prelats aſſaults have ever ſtood firme to this day; ſo your alleagencies are exceeding falſe, that the Presbiteries were erected without the Kings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and that in the yeare 1580 the Government of our Church was Epiſcopall, theſe are putide thredbare lyes.</p>

It was the cuſtom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ever from the Reformation, to keep generall Aſſemblies twice, or at leaſt once every yeare; After ſome debates in the yeare 1592. it became a Law, and an Act of Parliament, agreed to unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly by the King and States, and accordingly it was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed without any interruption, that the Generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhould meet at leaſt once a yeare, and appoint when all other actions were ended, the day and place for the next yeares meeting.

            <p>The Miniſters did plead further, that the privie Councell was not a competent Judicatorie to the queſtion, what was a lawfull, or unlawfull Aſſembly: that by the Lawes of the Kingdome ſuch queſtions were to be decided by a lawfull Generall Aſſembly, and not elſewhere.</p>
            <p>At that time Doctor <hi>Bancroft</hi> was Patron to the naughty Preacher of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who were panting for Biſhopricks, and as after the conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, he had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the King to cruſh the moſt of the gracious Brethren of <hi>England,</hi> who could not ſubmit to Epiſcopacie, and its Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; So then did he haſten a Meſſage to the Councell of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the condemning all who adhered to the Aſſembly of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> of high Treaſon. To maintaine a power in the Church to keep an Aſſembly, or in the State, to keep a Parliament whether to begin, or to continue it, when the King did diſcharge (though the Law did expreſly warrant it) was to oppoſe the Royall prerogative and could be no leſſe then the higheſt treaſon, eſpecially if any did decline the Judgement of the Privy Counſell, or any other Judicatorie, to which the King was pleaſed to referre the deciſion of this caſe: though the nature of the thing and the Law, did require the queſtion to bee determined in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Court.</p>
            <p>For this plea a number of gracious Miniſters were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:135324:37"/>by an Aſſize to be executed as Traitours, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after as it were of great favour, and ſpeciall grace their lives were ſpared, yet were they all preſently baniſhed, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to returne to any of the Kings Dominions while they lived.

            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, a complaint of raſh Excommunication, and perſecution therupon, is very impertinent from your mouth: it is not ſo long that yet it can be forgotten, ſince you and your Colleagues did allow your Officialls and others to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate good people for trifles, yea, for no offence at all, but their zeale to God, and the good of their Country: your Cannons in all the three Kingdomes are extant, your cruelties are freſh, in impriſoning, baniſhing, Pilloring, ſtigmatizing the worthieſt men for contradicting you in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one of your numerous ceremonies and traditions.</p>
            <p>As for the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that it did ever meddle to trouble any in their goods, Liberties, or perſons, it's very falſe: what civill penalties the Parliament of a Kingdome thinkes meet to inflict upon thoſe who are refractory, and unamendable by the cenſures of a Church, the ſtate from whom alone theſe puniſhments doe come, are anſwerable, and not the Church.</p>
            <p>That Excommunication in <hi>Scotland,</hi> is inflicted upon thoſe who cannot aſſent to every point of Religion determined in their confeſſion, there is nothing more untrue, for wee know it well, that never any perſon in <hi>Scotland,</hi> was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate only for his difference of opinion in a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logick tenet, Excommunication there, is a very dreadfull ſentence, and therefore very rare: theſe laſt forty yeares, ſo farre as I have either ſeen or heard, there has none at all been Excommunicate in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but ſome few trafficking Papiſts, and ſome very few notoriouſly flagitious perſons, and five or ſix of you the Prelates for your obſtinate impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, after your overturning the foundations both of our Church &amp; State, and one moſt rigid and pragmatick Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, who for all that could be done or ſaid, would needs make it his worke to perſwade all he was able by diſcourſe, Letters, and ſpreading of books, that in <hi>Scotland</hi> there was
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:135324:38"/>neither a Church, nor any Miniſtery nor any Ordinance.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Scotland</hi> wee count the ſpirituall Judgement of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication moſt heavie, but any temporall inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that follows upon it, is not very conſiderable: for firſt there is not any civill hazard at all to any excommunicate man, who will ſuffer himſelfe to be brought to any meaſure of repentance. Secondly, were they never ſo impenitent, ther is no harme can come to them (as I remember) a whole yeare after the long proceſſe and finall ſentence of Exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. Thirdly after a yeares co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumacy, though the Letter of the Act of Parliament be heavy, yet I appeale to any who has lived in <hi>Scotland,</hi> among the very few whom they have knowne Excommunicate, how many did they ever heare to have been hurt in their goods, impriſoned, or baniſhed. I am ſure that <hi>Huntly, Arrole,</hi> and <hi>Angus,</hi> and the other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Lords, though for their plotting to undermine the State, their perſons after Excommunication have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, yet no penny of their eſtates went to the Kings Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, or to the hands of any of their unfriends: but as the ordinary cuſtome is, upon the pretext of a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, what ever the Letter of the Law takes from them, it is all put in the hand of ſuch of their friends whom they doe moſt truſt; <hi>Scotlands</hi> guilt may well be too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, but of any exceſſive rigour towards ſpirituall oftenders, they will bee condemned by none that knowes them.

            <p>Your other imputation, that our generall Aſſembly takes upon it to be judge what is Treaſon, and who are fit to bee Counſellours, nothing is more falſe. But here you doe us the favour to prove your Alleageance by a long ſtory, to which I have given a full anſwer in the other Treatiſe: At that time of King <hi>James</hi> minority, <hi>Spotſwood</hi> himſelfe being witneſſe our State was miſerably miſguided, the Tyrannie of Captaine <hi>Iames,</hi> ſupported too much by the favour of the Earle of <hi>Lennex,</hi> was very grievous, both to Church and State: I touch but upon one inſtance. The greateſt ſubject of the Kingdome, and at that time neereſt to the King in blood was <hi>Iames Hamilton</hi> Earle of <hi>Arran,</hi> a very gracious and moſt brave man before his ſickneſſe: without
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135324:39"/>any fault at all, ſo much as alleaged for he was uncapable at that time of any crime, being vinted with a diſtemper that made him keep his houſe, and hindred him from meddling with any affaires of State, yet was he ſpoiled by the fraud and violence of Captaine <hi>Iames Stewart,</hi> of all his Lands and honour. This violent oppreſſour was made Earle of <hi>Arran,</hi> and Chancelour of the Kingdome. At that time the deſigne was cleere and confeſſed, to bring Queen <hi>Mary</hi> out of her priſon in <hi>England,</hi> to ſet her againe upon her Throne, to advance the Catholique League which then was newly made, betwixt the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> his grand Uncles and the King of <hi>Spain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What ever fault was in this action, the Aſſembly is unjuſtly charged therewith. Their advice was never ſought thereto, only halfe a yeare after it was done, his Majeſty ſent a ſpeciall Command to the Aſſembly for their approbation thereof: for as by divers of his Letters to all the neighbour Princes, he did ſignifie his good liking of that action, ſo in all the great Courts of the Kingdome hee required it to be approved. The privy Councell, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Eſtates, the generall Aſſembly by his Majeſties expreſſe Commiſſion did all aſſent to his will. It is true Captaine <hi>Iames,</hi> ſo ſoon as he crept in againe into Court, did change the young Kings mind, but the event of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration was a more horrible confuſion both of Church and State. The Earle of <hi>Gowry</hi> was beheaded; as a litt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This Rode of <hi>Stirling</hi> was much more cried out upon by the wicked Prelates and Courtiers, then the former
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135324:39"/>of <hi>Ruthven,</hi> yet was it approved for good ſervice to the King and State, not only as the former by the privie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To all this, our Apologie is briefe, what ever power our generall Aſſembly poſſeſſes, is all well allowed by the King and Parliament. The acts of that Aſſembly you complaine of, are all ratified by the State: the order of our proceeding is appointed by Law, all matters Spirituall and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, are firſt determined by the generall Aſſembly, if the nature of the things require a civill Sanction, the Votes of the Aſſembly are tranſmitted to the Parliament, if a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſembly have voted an Errour, or any thing that's wrong, and that corruption hath been ratified by an Act of Parliament: a Poſterior generall Aſſembly recognoſces the matter, and finding an errour in Religion, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the prior votes both of the Aſſembly and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, does condemne it, and appoints Commiſſioners to repreſent the reaſons of their vote to the next Parliament with an humble ſupplication to annull theſe Acts and Laws which did confirme the condemned corruption.

            <p>Is it a crime for Maſter <hi>Catherwood</hi> to write, that in all Kings naturally their is a hatred to Chriſt; what doe you here intend to cenſure? are not all men naturally enemies to God? unto this natural Corruption that is Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all fleſh does not great places in the world eſpecially Crowns and Throns, adde many provocations, from which poverty and meannes gives exemption; what would you here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove? ſpeake out plainly your Pelagian tenet, deny origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſin, make it one of the Royall Prerogatives in vertue of the Crowne, to be naturally gracious and an advancer of Chriſts Kingdome.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:135324:43"/>the Popiſh faction of <hi>Scotland</hi> did ſtill keep correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>Philip</hi> and his Miniſters both in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Weſt Flanders:</hi> Agents, Letters, Monies were ever going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them; great hopes yearly of a new Navy, which fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the Ieſuits moved <hi>Huntly</hi> and his complices to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe by themſelves; theſe things were all diſcovered. Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who in all the popiſh deſignes was primely ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at, did ſend frequent advertiſements of their plots, which by intelligencers in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſhe came to underſtand. The Generall Aſſembly did excommunicate <hi>Huntly,</hi> the head of that turbulent faction, The King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him Rebell, he was often relaxed from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence both civill and Eccleſiaſtick, yet he ever relapſed and entered in new conſpiracys for the overthrow of the Religion and Kingdome. The man was very bloody powerfull and active.</p>
            <p>After Chancellour <hi>Maitlands</hi> death the prime Courtiers were knowne Papiſts, and drew the Kings mind to receive <hi>Huntly</hi> againe into favour, contrary to the Supplications of all his well-affected Subjects, and the manifold Letters of the Queen of <hi>England;</hi> theſe ſame Courtiers under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of mannaging the Kings rent, did graſpe into their hands all the Offices of State, and favours of the Prince, to the extreame diſcontent of the moſt of their fellow Courtiers: Beſides all this, they made it their chiefe deſigne to kindle the Kings wrath againſt the moſt zealous of the Miniſtry; they brought matters to ſuch a paſſe in the beginning of <hi>December</hi> 1596. that the King in diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure did Command by Proclamation the Commiſſioners of the Generall Aſſembly to diſſolve, and goe out of <hi>Edinbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> they preſently obeyed the charge; So what ever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thereafter is unjuſtly charged upon that Committee, which long before the ſeventeenth day was diſſolved and gone out of Towne.</p>
            <p>On the ſixteenth day, <hi>Huntly,</hi> who had killed the Earle of <hi>Murray,</hi> had defeat <hi>Argyles</hi> Army, had come to the fields againſt the King in perſon, conſpired with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard to bring in the Armado, ſolicited often the Prince of <hi>Farma</hi> for a new Navy, plotted the taking of the King,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:135324:43"/>and killing of the Chancellour in his preſence, This man though both baniſhed and excommunicate, comming boldly to Court, put all <hi>Edinburgh</hi> in a juſt feare. So much the more, as in the morning o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>all Aſſembly commanded in the morning of the 17 Twenty foure of the cheefe and moſt zealous Citizens of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to depart the Towne. All theſe things fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out together put the people in extreame feare of a preſent Maſſacre by the hands of <hi>Huntly,</hi> of the popiſh Courtiers and their faction. To prevent this miſchiefe Mr. <hi>Balcanquall</hi> whom it fell to preach that day, after Sermon deſired the cheefe of them who were preſent to ſtay for adviſement what was needfull to be done for their owne ſafety: in the meeting, nothing at all was reſolved upon, but a humble ſupplication to his Majeſtie that they might be in ſecurity from the dangerous plotts of the Papiſts, That the Lady <hi>Huntly,</hi> an excommunicate Papiſt, might be removed from Court and ſent home, That three of the Counſellours knowne papiſts and correſpondents with <hi>Rome,</hi> (as their Letters thereafter found with the Pope did prove) might not vote at the Counſell Table in the cauſes of Miniſters, That the Citizens baniſhed out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinburgh</hi> without the allegeance of any cauſe might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their houſes. This moſt innocent Petition was ſent to his Majeſtie by two noble men, <hi>Lindſay</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,</hi> two Barons, <hi>Bargeny</hi> and <hi>Blachan,</hi> and two Miniſters, Maſter <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> and Maſter <hi>William Watſon.</hi> Maſter <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> did ſpeake to his Majeſtie ſo humbly and with ſo much reaſon that he gave no offence, but when his Majeſtie did enquire at the Noblemen how they durſt
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:135324:44"/>conveene without his expreſſe warrant; <hi>Lindſay,</hi> by kind a zealous Spirit, but ever moſt Loyall, being in paſſion at this, queſtion, that when their Lives and Religion (as they concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) were in extreame and preſent hazard, they ſhould be quarrelled for meeting in a peaceable manner, only to draw a modeſt ſupplication, did ſay, that they durſt doe more then meet, to ſupplicate; with theſe words his Majeſtie was offended but not in that degree as to caſt downe his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance on the Noble man therefore; only he went away without giving any anſwer to their petition.</p>
            <p>What here you add of your owne, of craving juſtice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Counſellors, of laying hold upon ſome of their garments, all is groſly falſe even <hi>Spotſwood</hi> being Judge; who had much better reaſon to know the Acts of that day then you, who then was ſcarce borne, but he was one of the moſt diligent of all the company, to arme himſelfe and all others he could, eſpecially his pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Meſſengers returning to them that ſent them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the matter as it was, that his Majeſtie had not deigned them with any anſwer at all this did much increaſe the feare of the whole company, while they are in conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion what to doe, ſome without the doors ſuborned by the malecontent Courtiers did cry, that <hi>Huntly</hi> and the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Lords were comming upon them to make a maſſacre: Maſter <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> did what he was able to compoſe the people, but amazement had ſtopped their eares, all got to their Arms, in which they did not continue a full half houre: for before the Sermon ended it behoved to be nere ten, and before they could conveene draw up their ſupplication, goe to the King and returne, doubtles it was more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven, and long before twelve all the tumult was quieted, the King on foot went downe the ſtreets in peace, to his dinner in the Abby, and came up againe to Counſell, before two of the clocke, no violence at all was ſo much as offered to any man. The people being frighted, and apprehending upon very probable grounds a preſent ſurpriſe of their towne and perſons, run to their Arms for defence, but finding no Enemie to appeare, preſently they laid aſide their weapons without any compulſion either from the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:135324:44"/>Hammer men or any other: for ſuch a poore reſiſtance, as all their oppoſits were able then to have made, could have ſaved no man out of their hand, to whom they had inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any reall harme.

He ſays indeed that Maſter <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> wrot ſome more to my Lord <hi>Hamilton,</hi> but who dare truſt a Prelates word when his deſigne is to diſgrace his enemy, or if all were true, what does the Letter of any particular Miniſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> or the Generall Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>This was the 17. day of <hi>December,</hi> the Courtiers and Prelaticall faction did exaggerate it to the moſt horrid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion that ever was upon the earth, but how unjuſtly.

Articles imputed to us.</note> you will yet adde as a mantiſſa and appendix, two other points, firſt you ſet down the twelve Articles of our Creed, Since you are ſo good at the confeſſing of your Neighbours, I would gladly know what your own faith may be: what you aſcribe here to us, ye doe it without any ground, either of reaſon or Authoritie: your ſimple aſſertions muſt be the very Articles of your Creed. Some yeares agoe we did ſee a book called <hi>Ladonſium Autocatacriſis,</hi> wherein by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall and expreſſe teſtimonies, not the articles of your faith, for you are an avowed paucifidian, but ſuch opinions as you and your companions did preach and print, are ſet down at large. Wherein it was demonſtrate, that you and your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome friends in <hi>Aberdeen</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> did hold groſſer Arminianiſme, Popery and Tiranny then the worſt of the Canterburians in <hi>England:</hi> alſo in the beginning of this Treatiſe, we did ſee under your owne hand, ſuch a confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of your faith, as few of the moſt malignant of your party will have the impudence to ſubſcribe it with you.</p>
            <p>But be your faith what it may, for it is like that times and occaſions may make you hide or open, yea, vary and change, as you find it moſt convenient for your purpoſe: I am content freely to tell you my mind, in all theſe Articles (as you ſtile them) of our Creed. I never heard of the firſt, but in your Pamphlet; no Presbiterian ever dreamed of any neceſſity, to change the government of the State, that it might be conforme to the Church; but many Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall and all Eraſtians doe hold the government of the Church to bee a matter of ſo indifferent arbitrary and changeable a nature, that it may well comply, and ought to be conformed to the model of every State wherein it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be entertained. The true tenet of all approved among us, ſo farre as I know is, that the government of the Church and State are two really diſtinct policies, both or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, which without his diſpleaſure may not bee confounded, nor ought not to encroach one upon another.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:135324:46"/>That the wrath of God will be on that Church, and on theſe Church-men, who for any advantage they apprehend, can come either to the Church, or to themſelves, will go to trouble or change any civil State, be it Monarchy, Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, Democracy, or what ever els, which by the juſt lawes of any people is ſetled in a Land; on the other ſide that God will be angry with every State, and all thoſe Stateſmen who for the advancement of their owne, or the States intereſt, will goe to impede, trouble, or change that government of the Church, which Chriſt in his Teſtament has left to his ſervants unto his ſecond comming.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond we doe maintaine a parity among Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, courting it an Antichriſtian ambition for any one, to make himſelfe Lord Biſhop over the reſt, but this is farre from any Democracy, for wee put all the Miniſters of a Kingdome under the juriſdiction of a Nationall Aſſembly, the rules whereof uſe to be ſo juſt and exact, that where they are reverenced, there is no danger of any popular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, much leſſe then where Epiſcopall either Tiranny, or Obligarchy does prevaile.</p>
            <p>For the third to our Conſiſtories we give no Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent power, theſe with us are all ſubordinate to Claſſicall Presbiteries, and to our Nationall Aſſemblies wee give no power to meddle with any temporall things at all, nor any Legiſlative power about things ſpirituall. When they have paſt their Votes upon a matter ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall according to the rules of the word of God. If any Law or civill Sanction bee needfull, they ſupplicate the Magiſtrate whom they never preſume to command to be an executioner of their Decrees, (theſe be but your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies) only they intreat him to make ſuch Laws as hee finds the equity of the matter in his own conſcience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. You indeed profeſſe an inthronization of Biſhops, and give to them not only a directive power over the King, but an authoritative to excommunicate him, and if he to ſave his Crowne will be content that his Parliaments doe with your Thrones and Myters what they thinke expedient; you print to the world, that this ſhall bring a remedileſſe and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:135324:46"/>perpetuall ruine both on the King and his people, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their poſterities.</p>
            <p>For the fourth, the Lawes of <hi>Scotland</hi> allow to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſembly a power to Judge of all divine truths and hereſies, ſo that if they find popiſh, Epiſcopall or what ever Errours eſtabliſhed by Acts of Parliament, yet they are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to proceed to give their ſentence from the word of God, not of the Law, but of the Errour, to which Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in their ignorance have procured a Sanction; as for the Law, the Parliament when they ſit, take it into their owne conſideration; never any Aſſembly of the reformed Church, dealt either with Prince or Parliament, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming of a Law otherwiſe then by humble ſupplication. What you ſpeake of a corrective power, the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did ever diſclaime it, all compulſion by outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenients they remitted ever to the State. As for the cenſures of the Church, no faction ever has been more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall of them both in doctrine and practiſe, then you and your gracious Brethren the Prelats.</p>
            <p>For the fifth, we exeem no Miniſter who preaches Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from the cogniſance and puniſhment of the Magiſtrate, only by the Laws of our Kingdome, the judgement of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters doctrine in the firſt inſtance, belongs to the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtich Judicatory.</p>
            <p>For the ſixth, we pretend no power to make the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate adde the civill Sanction to any of our Aſſemblies Decrees, further then his own conſcience, the Juſtice of the thing, the former Laws of the Land, the humble and earneſt deſire of the Subjects does plead for: but you before your Tippets and Rotchets be laid aſide, will permit three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes to be conſumed with fire and ſword, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: unleſſe your thrones may bee re-eſtabliſhed, King and people muſt be deſtroyed for ever; And this you tell us muſt be and ſhall be, but in many things wee have found you falſe prophets, and feare not your cauſeleſſe curſes.</p>
            <p>For the ſeventh, we maintain no power of the Church to reforme and preſerve Religion, but ſuch as does well conſiſt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:135324:47"/>with that duty which God has laid upon the Magiſtrate, both for the reformation of Religion, and preſervation of it when it is reformed.</p>
            <p>For the eight, wee maintaine that the ſins of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate does not excuſe the people for their neglect of any duty that God has laid upon them, and when Superiours are reſolved to live and dye in Idolatrie, we thinke that every inferiour Magiſtrate, and every perſon is obliged to keepe himſelfe free of corruption, and ſo farre as he is able, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his owne ſoule, but not to be a publick reformer of a Country without a lawfull calling.</p>
            <p>For the ninth, all the Covenants of our Land are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Acts of Parliament, and how ever by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>information of Prelats, the King for a time judged them il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legall, yet at laſt he found them juſt and neceſſary, according to the Laws and Cuſtomes of the Kingdome; wee indeed doe maintaine, when a handfull of wicked Prelats doe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Prince to deſtroy himſelfe and whole Kingdomes, that in that caſe it is lawfull for the Nobles and States of a Land to ſtand upon their guard, and wee cannot ſubſcribe to theſe prime fundamentall Articles of your faith, That the Supremacie of <hi>Britaine</hi> is ſo farre exalted above all Law divine and humane, that the Parliaments of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes for their moſt neceſſary defenſive Armes, are to be condemned by God and all men, for Traitors and Rebels, yet your good friends, the Idolatrous murtherers of <hi>Ireland,</hi> muſt be regiſtred to poſterity for good Catholick ſubjects. No marvell you beleeve all this, when you profeſſe your advice to all Princes, rather to admit of the worſt whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Rome,</hi> the very Jeſuitiſme of <hi>Raviliack</hi> and <hi>Faux,</hi> then of the Presbiteriall government. Behold whither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite may carry the ſpirit of an excommunicate Prelate.</p>
            <p>For the tenth, our Aſſemblies meddle not with queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of State, if the originall of royalty be ſo from heaven, that men on earth had never any hand in making of a King: if in any immaginable caſe, a King be cenſurable ſuch que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions were never propoſed ſo much as for debate in any Aſſembly of <hi>Scotland;</hi> unhappy Biſhops, who muſt needs
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:135324:47"/>prophane the Crowns of Kings, by making their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and myſterious Prerogatives, their ordinary quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libets to be toſſed as Tennis balls in their common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, Sermons and Pamphets. It was a very unhappy day for the Kings of <hi>Britaine,</hi> when the feet of Prelats got firſt leave to touch the threſhold of the Court, and their evill eyes to behold the Jewels of the Crown, or their ſoule hands to touch the hemme of the royall Robes: ſuch infauſt harppies polute all things though moſt ſacred, to which they approach.</p>
            <p>For the eleventh, though it never came to be ſcanned in any Aſſembly, yet I know no honeſt man of <hi>Scotland</hi> that makes queſtion of the thing. The King and Parliament has inacted the lawfulneſſe of our late defenſive Armes; but the Acts of that Parliament are not much to your mind, for they caſt you out of your native Country, as a prime incendiary unfit to breath more in that Aire.</p>
            <p>The twelfth is, but to make up the number, being the ſame with the former.</p>
            <p>The concluſion of your Articles, is but a malicious rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling invective, very ſutable to your mouth: it's contrary to reaſon and experience, as oft wee have ſaid before, but you cannot ſpare Tauttologies.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of your Appendix is your Poſtſcript,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 55.56. No ſhadow of Epiſcopacie remaines in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny well refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church.</note> wherein you make a large muſter of your Epiſcopall Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories and tell us that the major part of the reformed Churches in Chriſtendome, doe retaine Epiſcopacie alſo that the removall thereof from <hi>England,</hi> is the fountaine of all our preſent Sects: you may know that all our Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Sects, did breed under the wings of Epiſcopacie, the reaſon why now they appeare ſo thick in publick, is not the removall of Epiſcopacie, but the retarding of Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall government, and the plague of our too too long annarchie.</p>
            <p>That your Epiſcopacie is to be found in any reformed Church, is a great untruth, we grant it is to be ſeen in your Eaſterne and Weſterne Churches, the firſt of your Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue: but you would ſpeake a little more plainly, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:135324:48"/>people may underſtand your mind, what Weſterne Church is this that you propone unto us for a patterne of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy? is it any other then the good old Mother Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which many of you cry up for ſo true a Church, that all Proteſtants are Shiſmaticks, for their needleſſe ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-there-from, and that among Princes thoſe are moſt happy, who ſhall heale that breach, and once againe make us all to be one: under our holy Father the Pope, the firſt Biſhop of Chriſtendome, whom all the Biſhops in <hi>Britaine,</hi> and in the whole world, ought by a good Eccleſiaſtick right, to reverence as the firſt Patriarch, the conſtant moderator of all Oecumenick Counſells.</p>
            <p>Your Eaſterne Churches are thoſe of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> whoſe corruptions, albeit not like to theſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet are ſo many and groſſe, as none, but ſuch as you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone them for patternes of imitation.</p>

               </gap> Catalogue you are pleaſed to play the Herauld and Coſmographer, of purpoſe to terrifie ſimple people, by the many names of your large territories. You know the world ſcornes the Rodomontades of <hi>Spain,</hi> their King muſt not be ſtiled as his neighbours of <hi>France,</hi> and great <hi>Britaine:</hi> but he will be called the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> the King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> the King of <hi>Leon,</hi> and a large <hi>&amp; caetera</hi> of many Kingdomes, yet all in <hi>Spaine.</hi> Might you not have ſaid that Epiſcopacie was continued in all the Lutheran Churches of <hi>Germany,</hi> which will not make the third part of that Country, deducing the Calviniſts and Papiſts.</p>
            <p>In your great vanity you reckon up the Earldome of <hi>Henneberg, Lenning,</hi> and theſe that follow to the number of Thirteene, as if they were all great, and conſiderable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces: and yet put them all together, they will ſcarce make up one fifth part of ſome Engliſh ſhires.</p>
            <p>But for the matter, are the Lutheran Churches eſteemed by any well adviſed Proteſtants the beſt reformed, whereof our Covenant ſpeaks; It ſeems, the worſe Churches be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed you like them the better, for they are ſo much neerer to your beſt beloved in <hi>Rome,</hi> but true Covenanters are not of your mind.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:135324:48"/>
            <p>Further, what you ſpeake of the Lutheran Churches is altogether falſe: That in <hi>Germany,</hi> or any where elſe among Proteſtants, any thing which you call Epiſcopacie is to be ſound, I marvell if you ſhould beleeve it: for I pray where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, except in <hi>England,</hi> did any Proteſtants ſpoile all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of all power, both of Ordination and Juriſdiction to put it in the hand of one Prelat: to be exerciſed either by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, or by any depute Eccleſiaſtick, or civill, as he thought fitteſt.</p>
            <p>The Dutch Superintendens are as like to Engliſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, as an Emperour in the dayes of <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Dutch Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents are very farre from the Engliſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</note> when the Senate ruled all, to an Emperour in the dayes of <hi>Tiberius</hi> or <hi>Nero,</hi> when an abſolute Prince, I will not ſay a Tirant, did governe all at his pleaſure.

            <p>While you caſt your ſelfe upon the Smectymnians, and will ſtill raile upon our Covenant, we deſiderate your pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but while you appeale to <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> for your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacie, we miſſe your Common ſence. All the Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which ever you had or ever aimed at, was moſt immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and the moſt moderate Epiſcopacie that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, is a meere human invention, which has no ground at all in the word of God; which in all times and places has proved unhappy to the Church, and which at this time is talked of by ſome for no other end, but to be a new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ſtep to ſuch a Prelacie as may be ſerviceable to the Prince as before, for the advanceing of his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in Church and State, above all Law and reaſon. How ridiculous is it to heare moſt immoderate ſpirits talke of moderation: to ſpeake of a moderate Epiſcopacie, a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Popedome, a moderate Tyranny, is to tell us of a chaſt Bordell an honeſt couſinage a meeke murther, and ſuch like repugnancies: men now are no more childiſh to be couzened by your diſtinctions out of their Covenant.</p>

As for the firſt Act, the explanation here made upon it did no way remove its offence, for both the Act and its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation attribute to the Miniſters only the adminiſtation of the Word and Sacraments, without any mention at all of any diſcipline; this ſeems to have been one chiefe cauſe why the worſhipfull Licenſer was preſſed with ſo much importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to give his <hi>Imprimatur</hi> to this Writ, as if this paſſage had been a demonſtration of King <hi>James</hi> his Eraſtianiſme; but let the world take notice of the groſſeneſſe of this miſtake by this ſhort information.</p>

Maſter <hi>Melvil</hi> was an excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, the principall profeſſour of Divinity in the Univerſity firſt of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and then of S. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> full of piety, eloquence and learning of all ſorts; ſo eminent in zeale for the truth, that his remembrance is yet very precious, not in <hi>Scotland</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but in other reformed Churches; his heroicke courage made him an eye-ſore to the Maſters of the Court, whoſe wickedneſſe he and his Schollars, according to their place and duty, did maſculouſly oppoſe. From this it was, and nothing elſe, that an Accuſation was invented againſt him, as for ſeditious and treaſonable words againſt the Kings Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> then priſoner in <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>When he came to his Anſwer upon his ſolemne Oath,

            <p>If this be the ſupremacy which the reprinters of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration aime at, we grant that many Prelats and Courtiers have alwayes been of their mind; but I aſſure them, the <hi>Scots</hi> Divines did ever abhorre ſuch ſlaviſh maximes; ſuch a ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy has alwayes been the fundamentall Law in the grand Segniors Port at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> it has been for many yeers the poſſeſſed Prerogative of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchs; alſo from their example, it has been the aime and endeavour not onely of other Kings, but almoſt of all Princes and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne States, how pettie ſoever; ſo much is a ſovereigne deſpotick and uncontroleable Domination, naturally belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all who are in any neerneſſe or hope to attaine it: But it is a morſell that has ſtuck with ſo many in the ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and poyſoned ſo many in the digeſtion, though ſwallowed downe, that few who are wiſe, will adventure any more to taſte of it; notwithſtanding if the appetite of the publiſhers of this Writ will not be ſatisfied with any thing leſſe then ſuch a Supremacy, let them be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider:</p>
            <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">If either King or Parliament admit of it, it wil overthrow both, and the whole Nation with them.</note> that this kind of ſupremacy will fall upon a ſubject where their harts wil be loath it ſhould lodg, it wil be found rather a part of the royall Prerogative, then any Priviledge of Parliament; and although according to their good friends laſt warning to the City, the Crowne were broken in pieces, and the whole royall Prerogative devolved upon the head of the Parliament, yet the aforementioned ſupremacy is ſo high an injuſtice, that no gracious member of either Houſe would ever be perſwaded to touch it though it were put in their fingers; for beſide the everting of all the Lawes whereupon Monarchy ſince the firſt foundation has ſtood, it would ſo ſhake the groundſtones of all the Lawes of the Kingdome, as

As theſe Acts of Parliament were firſt made by King <hi>James,</hi> and the States of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and now alſo rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by King <hi>Charles,</hi> ſo both the Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> cannot but approve thereof, having joyned themſelves by Oath and Covenant with <hi>Scotland,</hi> to extirpate the unhappy root of Epiſcopacy, which has been the great cauſe of the moſt miſchiefes which in this laſt Age hath befallen <hi>Brittaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third crime for which the general Aſſembly behoved to be put down,
<note place="margin">It was no fault in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies that they called to Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> was their indicting of ſoleme Faſts; in which, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions &amp; tumults againſt the King were promoved; conſider that the quarrell is not ſimply for the Faſts, but their evill uſe, to raiſe ſeditions and tumults; certainly that cuſtome of our Church, wherby from the beginning of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135324:63"/>to this day, every Church meeting from the general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the ſmalleſt Congregationall Elderſhip, had power as they found cauſe, to indict a publick Faſt within their owne bounds, is very innocent and neceſſary for the well being of the Church.</p>
            <p>As for the alleaged abuſe of theſe Faſts to ſedition and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
<note place="margin">Guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences hate Faſts without cauſe.</note> it is a meer calumny; the matter I beleeve was this: About the time of the penning of this Writ, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of publick Faſting, did make mention in their Sermons and Prayers, of the wickedneſſe of the Land, for which the wrath of God was much feared by the godly; the Leaders of the Court conſcious of their owne guiltineſſe, took themſelves to be particularly pointed at, and for this did hate extreamly eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zealous Preacher, as if all their Sermons and Prayers had been invectives for ſtirring up of the people againſt them, while in truth theſe gracious men did nothing but their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, containing themſelves within the lines of all needfull moderation; but to wicked men in their pride and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the leaſt touch of the Word of God is an intolerable wound.</p>
            <p>The explanation of the laſt Act,
<note place="margin">The ſum of the next Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph.</note> containes the maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Epiſcopacy in the higheſt degree, it puts in the hand of the Biſhop, the whole ſpirituall Juriſdiction of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to be exerciſed by him alone, although with the advice of ſome few whom he ſhall pleaſe to chooſe for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours; it imports, that all his Juriſdiction flowes from the King, and in the exerciſe thereof, it makes the Biſhop anſwerable onely to the King, and them whom his Majeſty ſhall appoint in an Aſſembly of his owne framing; it makes the Biſhops alſo Lords of Counſell and Parliament.</p>
            <p>Upon this paſſage I marke firſt,
<note place="margin">The Reprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this <hi>De claration</hi> make no conſcience of their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> the conſcience and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of theſe men, who with ſo great importunity required the reprinting of this Declaration, and to make its operation the more effectual in the hearts of ſimple people, would be at the coſt to change the language thereof, to ſet it downe firſt in <hi>Scotch</hi> and then in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a piece of paines ſo farre as I know never taken with any other Writ; this diligence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates the mens humour; I can hardly ſay, whether
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:135324:64"/>more ſcornfull of the <hi>Scots</hi> and their language, or paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous to diſgrace that Church, though it were with the exalting of Epiſcopacy; and if (as I ſuppoſe) they have taken the Covenant, this encreaſeth my wonder, how any who have ſolemnly ſworne to defend the reformation of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to endeavour the extirpation of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, can in a ſudden become ſo zealous and put themſelves to ſo great pains, in diſgrace of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> reformation to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Preſacy. If either Independency or Eraſtianiſme have power to let looſe the Reines of conſcience ſo far; we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the <hi>Scots</hi> have been too ſimple, in beleeving that Oathes and Covenants in plaine matters, which admit no ambiguity nor plurality of ſenſes, had beene farre ſtraiter bonds among all who had the eſtimation of honeſt men, and in whom there could be found the leaſt ſparkle of any ingenuity or truth.</p>
            <p>Conſider ſecondly, that King <hi>James</hi> (as I have ſaid) did give it under his hand to the Commiſſioners of the Church the yeer following, that this Declaration was none of his, but the work of <hi>Adamſon</hi> of Saint <hi>Andrewes,</hi>
               <note n="lll" place="margin">Vide ſupra.</note> and that this man at laſt was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of his errour, confeſſing upon Oath and ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Epiſcopacy to be a groſſe corruption, a ſtirrop for the Pope to aſcend to his Antichriſtian ſaddle, an errour which he had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and wherein from time to time, he was entertained by the <hi>Engliſh Prelates</hi>
               <note n="mmm" place="margin">Adamſons Recantation: <hi>The laſt Article contained the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of a Biſhop, which hath no warrant in the Word of God, but is grounded upon the policy and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man, whereupon the primacy of the Pope or Antichriſt is riſen, which is worthy to be diſallowed and and forbidden.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whatever here is ſaid of Biſhops, is not now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted in the Parliaments of both Kingdomes, and in the ſolemne League of both Nations, it is expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as all doe confeſſe; if any anti-covenanting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant require a further debate, when they will, they may have a hearing and an anſwer.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, when the Commiſſioners of the church did declare
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:135324:64"/>to King <hi>James,</hi>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:135324:65"/>I hope they who are ſo earneſt to have King <hi>James</hi> heard in this cauſe, though in a falſe and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitious Writ, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to hear him in his true Declaration under his own hand.</p>
            <p>The third part of the Writ containes an enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Majeſties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions;
<note place="margin">The pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intentions were not the Kings, but the Prelats.</note> concerning them we need adde little to what is ſaid, onely conſider, firſt, that <hi>Adamſon</hi> the Author of the Writ, aſſures us, that there is nothing or little here of the Kings intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<note n="ppp" place="margin">Recantation: <hi>I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprized of meere remorſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to write againſt a Book, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> The Declaration of the Kings Majeſties intentions; <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it containeth little or nothing of the Kings intentions, but of my own, in the time of the writing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the corrupt intentions of ſuch as for the time were about the King, and abuſed his minority; in the whole Book is nothing contained but aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of lyes, aſcribing to the Kings Majesty that whereof he was not cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; I grant I was more buſie with ſome Biſhops in</hi> England, <hi>in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the diſcipline of our Kirke, partly when I was there, and partly ſince, by mutuall intelligence then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a good Christian, much leſſe a faithfull Pastor.</hi>
               </note> being that he did here ſet downe onely his owne intentions, and theſe of the Courtiers and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, at that time of their higheſt pride and greateſt oppreſſion of the religious party.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">The Reprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Writ ſeeme to bee perjured men, and either hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates.</note> the errours and faults that appeare in theſe intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are of two kinds, Prelaticall and Eraſtian: For the firſt, not onely the Author did recant them, but alſo as we have now often ſaid, King <hi>James</hi> with the States Aſſembled in Parliament, did expreſly condemne them, and at this time they ſtand condemned
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:135324:65"/>in the whole Iſle by King <hi>Charles</hi> in his Parliament of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by both the Houſes of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> who ever now wil tak the patrociny of the Prelaticall war, doth ſet his face againſt the King and Parliaments of both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and if he be a member of Parlia. in either Nation (whoaccording to his place muſt needs have ſworn the National Covenant) for his endeavor to eſtabliſh what by his Covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he was bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to his power, to have extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated; Let him be caſt with ignominy out of theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Senates as a falſe and perjured hypocrite, planting by deed what by Oath and Covenant he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to eradicat; or elſe an Apoſtate, repenting and retracting while now he is ſet in Parliament, what at his entry upon oath he promiſed, that he might be permitted to ſit downe; ſuch perjured, whether hypocriſie or apoſtacy, cannot but be abominable both to God and all ingenuous men.</p>
            <p>As for the Eraſtianiſme of theſe intentions,
<note place="margin">Ceſaro-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſme is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme worſe then that of the Pope.</note> whereby the Biſhops are made pleni-potentiaries in the Church, by vertue of a Commiſſion from the Magiſtrate, we have ſhewed at length how farre King <hi>James</hi> diſclaimed this errour as a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſinne againſt the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt; for the thing it ſelfe makes the Magiſtrate head of the Church, and fountaine of all Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdiction: This Ceſaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papiſme is an Antichriſtianiſme, ſo much worſe then that of the Pope, as more uncontrolable and remedileſſe; the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God in their wraſtlings againſt the Antichiſtianiſme
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:135324:66"/>of the Pope and Prelats, had often times great aſſiſtance, and were ever in a poſſibility to be aſſiſted by their Princes and Magiſtrates; but if the Magiſtrate himſelf will turn Pope, and take upon him to diſpence the ſpirituall Juriſdiction, one part thereof to civill Commiſſioners, another part to the Congregationall Elderſhip, a third to the Claſſis, a fourth to whom he will, and in the end, as all did flow from him, make all againe to returne by a finall appeale to himſelfe, when the ſervants of Chriſt are neceſſitate to oppoſe and preach againſt this uſurpation of their Maſters royall Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and for their labour are perſecute as oppoſers of the Magiſtrate, to whom ſhall they flee for defence?</p>
            <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">The ſimpathy and antipathy of Biſhops &amp; Eraſtians.</note> conſider how in theſe intentions Prelacy and Eraſtianiſm are linked together; it is true, the genuine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Epiſcopacy doe overturne Eraſtianiſme, and Prelats where ever they conceive themſelves bottomed and rooted in a Land, will be loath to fetch their pedegree from any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will and Commiſſion, but will ſtand upon a divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or at leaſt ſuch an Eccleſiaſticke right, as depends not upon the Magiſtrates pleaſure; this was the caſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hierarchy of late: Yet where Epiſcopacy is not ſo firmly grounded as it conceives it ſelfe immoveable and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, it is a very devout handmaid to Eraſtianiſme; and this was the condition of Prelacy in <hi>England,</hi> when theſe intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were written, for at that time the Biſhops were glad to keepe not onely their Civill, but all their Eccleſiaſtick Courts in the name and by the Commiſſion onely of the Prince, deriving all their Juriſdiction, and whatever they had peculiar, above and differing from any Miniſter of their Dioceſſe, from the Prince onely, aſcribing to him not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Architectonick, but a truly Eccleſiaſtick power, as a chiefe part of the royall Supremacy and Prerogative of the Crowne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adamſon</hi> the very yeer before he wrote his intentions, learned theſe Leſſons in <hi>England</hi> from the Prelats and Courtiers of the Queen; with whom, he confeſſed at laſt to his griefe, he had been too intimate; albeit when he came to <hi>Scotland,</hi> he thought it not expedient to vent to that people, or poſſibly he was not perſwaded in his owne mind of the whole body ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:135324:66"/>of the Eraſtian or of the Epiſcopall maximes; for in this Writ the Presbyterian, Eraſtian and Epiſcopall maximes are ſo inconſiderately intermixed, that the man ſeems not to have been very carefull, how their contrary qualities ſhould be ſo contemperated as the whol lump might not be diſſolved by repugnancies. It can be pretty well demonſtrate how E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, as it was for a long time in <hi>England,</hi> may well ſtand upon an Eraſtian bottome: alſo how handſomly the Eraſtian principles may in a ſhort time bring back the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Deanes and Chapters from their baniſhment;
<note place="margin">Both agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Presbyterians.</note> but how a true and ſolid Apoſtolick Presbytery is compatible either with Epiſcopacy, or a Magiſtraticall Popedome (though there were not a Covenant) I doe not conceive.</p>
            <p>Our laſt remark upon the intentions is,
<note place="margin">King <hi>James</hi> againſt all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration either of hereſie or ſchiſme.</note> that however they be ſpotted with many and groſſe both Prelaticall and Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian errours, yet they demonſtrate ſo much orthodoxie and zeale remaining in theſe worſt times among the Courtiers and Prelats of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as will beare witneſſe if it be not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, againſt our times where much more piety, and that upon ſtronger obligations, is profeſt; for firſt, the King is made to avow his reſolution to ſet up in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies for the ſuppreſſing of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by the Word of God ſhould be found either he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie or ſchiſm;
<note n="qqq" place="margin">Kings Declaration, p. 22. <hi>His Majesties intention is, if any question of faith and doctrine ariſe to convocate the moſt learned, godly, wiſe and experimented Pastors, that by conference of Scriptures the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be tryed, and all hereſie and ſchiſme by that meanes be repreſſed.</hi>
               </note> but how many yeers ſhal we ſee both begin and end, before the pittifull complaints of the godly, both here &amp; abroad ſhall procure the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to hereſies or ſchiſms which now in this Kingdom are become more groſſe and impudent then ever in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome before, or at this day in all the Kingdomes of the earth together. This monſtrous toleration cannot eſchew to draw the diſpleaſure of the God of truth upon the Authors, fomenters and favourers thereof; ſuch a long indifferency and lukewarmneſſe, ſuch a miſregard of the truth of God, ſuch a connivence and compliance with errours of all kind
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:135324:67"/>in a people, ever before famous for zeale, is moſt mervai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">Alſo contrary to our preſent hatefull Anat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</note> the King in that very houre of his darkneſſe is made to profeſſe his intention to countenance all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Judicatories of the Church, and in no wiſe to hinder any good order which from the Word of God in theſe mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, ſhould be eſtabliſhed;
<note n="rrr" place="margin">Ibid. <hi>His Majesties inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not to derogate unto the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary judgement of matters of the Church by the ordinary Biſhops, their Counſels and Synods, nor to hinder or ſtay any godly ſolid order grounded upon the Word of God.</hi>
               </note> Why then in our dayes of ſo great light, ſhould the whole Church lye ſtill in a totall Anarchy? did ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtian Nation for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yeers without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, abide without all Eccleſiaſtick government? If men had taken a Commiſſion from the Father of lyes, and author of wickedneſſe, to be his avowed agents in propagating er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, vice and all miſchiefes, could they for their life invent a better meanes for furthering theſe deſignes, then to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue this Anarchy, then to be pragmatick and pregnantly inſtrumentall in putting one impediment after another in the way; I hope there are many in the Parliament, Aſſembly and Kingdome, whoſe heart bleeds in their breſt to ſee their hands ſo long tyed, that they cannot get the hedge of the Church ſet up, to keep out the devouring Beaſts from the flock.</p>

                     <p>UNderſtanding the proceedings of the Aſſembly in my contrair, and being now with-holden by ſickneſſe from preſenting my ſelfe before you, that I might give confeſſion of that Doctrine wherein I hope God ſhall call me: And that at his pleaſure I might depart in the unity of Chriſtian Faith; I thought good by Writ to utter the ſame unto your wiſdomes, and to crave your godly wiſdomes aſſiſtance, not for the reſtitution of any worldly pompe or preheminence, which I little reſpect; but to remove from me the ſlanders which are raiſed in this Countrey concerning the variance of Doctrine, eſpecially on my part; wherein I proteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, that I have onely a ſingle reſpect to his glory, and by his grace I ſhall abide herein unto my lives end.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, I confeſſe the true Doctrine of Chriſtian Religion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:135324:68"/>to be publickly taught and rightly announced within this Realme, and deteſt all Popery and Superſtition: Like as (bleſſed be God) I have deteſted the ſame in my heart the ſpace of thirty yeeres, ſince it pleaſed God to give me the knowledge of the truth, wherein I have walked uprightly as well here as in other Countries, as the Lord beareth me record, untill theſe laſt dayes, wherein partly for Ambition and vain-glory to be preferred before my Brethren, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Covetouſneſſe, to poſſeſſe the pelfe of the Kirk, I did undertake this Office of an Archbiſhop, wherewith juſtly the fincereſt Profeſſours of the Word have found fault, and have condemned the ſame as impertinent to the office of a ſincere Paſtor of Gods Word. And albeit men would colour the ſame and imperfections thereof with divers cloaks, yet the ſame cannot be concealed from the ſpirituall eyes of the faithfull; neither yet can the men of God, when they are put to their conſcience, diſſemble the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Next, I confeſſe that I was in an erronious opinion, that I beleeved the Government of the Kirk to be like unto the Kingdomes of the earth, plaine contrary to the command of our Maſter Chriſt, and the Monarchy whereby the Kirk is Governed; not only to be in the perſon of our Saviour Chriſt (as it is) but in the Miniſters, who are nothing but vaſſals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, in an equality amongſt themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that I married the Earle of <hi>Huntlie</hi> contrary to the command of the Kirk, without the confeſſion of his Faith and profeſſion of the ſincere Doctrine of the Word: I repent, and crave pardon of God.</p>
                     <p>That I travelled both by reaſoning and otherwiſe, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Kirk-men to the Kings Ordinance in things that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine unto Eccleſiaſticall matters, and things of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: I aske God mercy; whereupon great enormities have falne forth in this Countrey.</p>
                     <p>That I beleeved, and ſo taught, the Presbyteries to be a fooliſh invention, and ſo would have it eſteemed of all men; which is an Ordinance of Chriſt: I crave God mercy.</p>
                     <p>Further, I ſubmit my ſelfe to the mercy of God, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Aſſembly, not meaſuring my offences by my owne ſelfe, nor by the infirmities of my owne ingyne; but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:135324:68"/>by the good judgement of the Kirk, to the which alwayes I ſubject my ſelfe, and beſeech you to make interceſſion to God for me, and to the King, that I may have ſome meanes to live and conſume the reſt of this my wretched time; for winning of whoſe favours (which fooliſhly I thought thereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine) I committed all theſe errors.</p>
                     <p>As where I am burthened to be the ſetter forth of the Book called <hi>The Kings Declaration,</hi> wherein the whole order of the Kirk is condemned and traduced; I proteſt before God that I was commanded to write the ſame by the Chancellour for the time, but chiefly by the Secretary, another great Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, who himſelfe penned the ſecond Act of Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Power and Authority of Judicature to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in the King; and that it ſhould not be lawfull for any Subject to reclaime from the ſame under the penalty of the Act: which I ſuppoſe was treaſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Item,</hi> Where it is alledged, that I ſhould have condemned the Doctrine anounced and taught by the Miniſtry of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brough,</hi> concerning obedience to the Prince: I confeſſe and proteſt before God, that I never underſtood nor yet knew any thing, but ſincerity and uprightneſſe in the Doctrine of the Miniſtry of <hi>Edinbrough,</hi> in that point nor in any other.</p>
                     <p>Further, I confeſſe I was the Authour of the Act diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Miniſters Stipends that did not Subſcribe theſe Acts of Parliament, wherewith God has juſtly recompenced my ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>As for any violent courſe, it is knowne well enough who was the Author thereof, and my part was tryed at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of Maſter <hi>Nicholl Dalgleiſh,</hi> Maſter <hi>Thomas Jack,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, I grant I was more buſie with ſome Biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> in prejudice of the Diſcipline of our Kirk; partly when I was there, and partly by our mutuall intelligence ſince, then became a good Chriſtian, much leſſe a faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor. Neither is there any thing that more aſhameth me, then my often deceiving and abuſing of the Kirk heretofore by Confeſſions, Subſcriptions, Proteſtations, &amp;c. which be farre from me now and ever hereafter, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <p>As where ye require what became of the Books of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, all which I had preſerved whole unto the returning of the Lords and Miniſtry out of <hi>England:</hi> And if I had not preſerved them, my Lord <hi>Arran</hi> intended to have made them be caſt into the fire; and upon a certaine day in <hi>Falkland</hi> they were delivered to the Kings Majeſty; the Biſhop of <hi>N.</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Maſter <hi>Henry Hamilton</hi> rent out ſome leaves, and deſtroyed ſuch things as made againſt our Eſtate, and that not without my owne ſpeciall allowance.</p>
                     <p>As for the Books which I have ſet forth; I have ſet forth nothing except a Commentary upon the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which I did direct to the Kings Majeſty, and kept no example beſide me, and underſtand that Maſter <hi>John Geddy</hi> got the ſame from the King, and lent it to Maſter <hi>Robert Hep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Further, I wrote nothing, but onely made mention in my Preface upon the Apocalips; that I ſhould write a Booke called <hi>Pſyllas,</hi> which (being prevented by diſeaſe) God would not ſuffer me to finiſh; and the little thing that was done, I cauſed to deſtroy it. And likewiſe I have ſet forth the Book of <hi>Job</hi> with the Apocalyps, and the Lamentations of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> all in Verſe to be printed in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for my intention, I am not diſpoſed or in ability to write any thing at this time; and if it pleaſe God I were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to my health, I would change my Style, as <hi>Cajetanus</hi> did at the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Sutlivins</hi> Booke againſt the forme and order of the Presbyteries, ſo far am I from being partner in that worke, that as I know not the Man, nor ever had any intelligence of the Worke, before it was done; ſo, if it pleaſe God to give me dayes, I will write in his contrary, to the maintenance of the contrary confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>Prayes the Brethren to be at unity and peace with me; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:135324:69"/>in token of their forgiveneſſe, becauſe health ſuffereth me not to goe over to the Colledge where preſently ye are aſſembled, which I would gladly doe, to aske God and you forgiveneſſe, that it would pleaſe you to repaire hither that I may doe it here.</p>
                     <p>Moreover I condemne by this my ſubſcription, whatſoever is contained in the Epiſtle Dedicatory to the Kings Majeſty, before my Book on the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that is either ſlanderous or offenſive to the Brethren: Alſo, I promiſe to ſatisfie the Brethren of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> or any other Kirk within this Realm, according to good conſcience in whatſoever they find themſelves juſtly offended, and for what is contrary to the Word of God, in any ſpeeches, actions or proceedings which have paſt from me.</p>
                     <p>And concerning the Commentary upon the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> becauſe there are divers things therein contained of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, and that tend to allow of the eſtate of Biſhops, otherwiſe then Gods Word can ſuffer, I condemne the ſame.</p>

                  <p>I Have enterprized of meere remorſe of conſcience to write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Booke called, <hi>A Declaration of the Kings Majesties inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:135324:70"/>Albeit it containeth little or nothing of the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, but my owne, at the time of the writing thereof, and the corrupt intentions of ſuch as were for the time about the King, and abuſed his Minority: Of the which Booke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thereof compiled by me, at the command of ſome chiefe Courtiers for the time (as is before written.) I ſhall ſhortly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my opinion, as the infirmity of ſickneſſe and weakneſſe of Memory will permit.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the whole booke is nothing contained but aſſertions of lyes, aſcribing to the Kings Majeſty that, whereof he was not culpable; For albeit, as the times went, his Majeſty could have ſuffered theſe things to have been publiſhed in his Realme; yet his Majeſty was never of that nature to have reviled any mans perſon, or to upbraid any man with calumnies, whereof there is a number contained in that Book</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the Declaration of the ſecond Act of Parliament there is mention made of Maſter <hi>Andrew Melvill</hi> and his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrongfully condemned, in ſpeciall as factious and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, albeit his Majeſty hath had a lively tryall of that mans fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and truth in all proceedings from time to time: True it is, he is earneſt and zealous who can abide no corruption (which moſt unadviſedly I attribute to a fiery and ſalt humour) which his Majeſty findeth by experience to be moſt true, for he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth well of him, and knoweth things that were alleaged upon him to have been falſe and contrived treacheries.</p>
                  <p>There are contained in that ſecond Act of Parliament diverſe other falſe inventions for to defame the Miniſtry, and to bring the Kirk of God in hatred and envy with their Prince and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, burthening and accuſing the Miniſters falſly of ſedition and other crimes, whereof they were innocent: As likewiſe it is written in the ſame act and Declaration thereof, that ſoveraigne and ſupreame power pertaineth to the King in matters Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, which is worthy to be condemned and not to be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among Chriſtian acts, where the power of the Word is to be extolled above all the power of Princes, and they to be brought under ſubjection to the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The fourth act condemned the Presbyteries, as a judgement not allowed by the Kings Lawes, which is a very ſlender argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:135324:70"/>for as concerning the authority of the Presbytery, we have the ſame expreſt in the Goſpell of <hi>Matthew,</hi> chap. 18. where Chriſt commandeth to ſhew the Kirk, which authority being commanded by Chriſt, and the Acts of Parliament forbidding it, we ſhould rather obey God then man; and yet the Presbytery lacked never the Kings authority for the allowance thereof from the beginning, ſave onely in that hour of darkneſſe when he was abuſed through evill company.</p>
                  <p>As for any other thing that is contained in this Act againſt any Order or proceedings of the Presbytery, it is to be eſteemed that nothing was done by the Presbytery without wiſdome, judgement and diſcretion. And ſo hath received approbation againe by the Kirk, whereunto alſo I underſtand, his Majeſty hath given allowance, ratifyed, and approved the ſame, which ſhould be a ſufficient reaſon to repreſſe all mens curioſity that either have or would yet finde fault with the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Article containeth the eſtabliſhing of Biſhops, which hath no warrant of the Word of God, but is grounded upon the Policy of the invention of Man; whereupon the Primacy of the Pope or Antichriſt has riſen, which is worthy to be diſallowed and forbidden, becauſe the number of Elderſhips that have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and overſight as well of viſitation as admiſſion, will doe the ſame farre more Authentickly, godly, and with greater zeale then a Biſhop, whoſe care commonly is not upon God and and his duty, but upon the world, whereupon his chiefe attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is. Conſider how that Office hath been uſed theſe five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth yeeres by gon, with what cruelty and tyranny it hath been exerciſed; ye ſhall finde it to have been the chiefe cauſe that hath in every Countrey ſuppreſſed the Word of God, which ſhall be evident to all that read the Hiſtory of the Kirk. As for my own opinion, it ſeemeth to be neereſt the truth, and fartheſt from all kind of ambition, that the Brethren in equall degree aſſemble themſelves under their Head Chriſt; and there every man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his Office carefully, as he is commanded. And becauſe weakneſſe of memory and ſickneſſe ſuffereth me not at length to diſcourſe on theſe matters as I would, I muſt requeſt the good Reader to aſſure himſelfe, that I have written this without co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Your rememberance is very ſweet and comfortable to my ſoule, ſince the firſt time I knew you in Chriſt, I have ever been mindfull of you to the Lord; and now not being able to refraine any longer, I could not omit this occaſion; not knowing how long it may pleaſe the Lord to continue my being in this Tabernacle, or give me further occaſion of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to any.</p>

                  <p>But I muſt remember my ſelfe, I know I have been greatly ſtrengthned and ſuſtained by your prayers (honourable La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and dearly beloved in our Lord Jeſus) continue I pray you, as ye have begun, in wreſtling with the Lord for me, that Chriſt may be magnified in my mortall body whether living or dead, that my ſoule may be lifted up to thoſe third heavens, that I may taſte of thoſe joyes that are at the right hand of my heavenly Father, and that with gladneſſe I may

                  <p>To witneſſe that good confeſſion,
<note place="margin">The matter of this gracious mans ſuffering was the very controverfie now in hand betwixt us and the Eraſtian Stateſmen.</note> that Jeſus Chriſt is the King of Saints, and that his Church is a moſt free King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; yea, as free as any Kingdome under heaven, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to convocate, hold and keep her meetings, Conventions and Aſſemblies, but alſo to judge of all her affaires in all her meetings and conventions amongſt her members and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects <hi rend="sup">d</hi>.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two points, firſt, that Chriſt is the head of his Church; ſecondly, that ſhe is free in her government from all other juriſdiction except Chriſts: Theſe two points, I ſay, are the ſpeciall cauſe of our impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, being now convict as traitors for their maintainance; we have been waiting with joyfulneſſe to give the laſt teſtimony of our blood in confirmation thereof; if it would pleaſe our God to be ſo favourable as to honour us with that dignity: yea, I doe affirme that theſe two points above written, and all other things which belong to Chriſts Crowne, Scepter and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, are not ſubject, nor cannot be to any other authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but to his owne altogether, ſo that I would be moſt glad to be offered up upon the ſacrifice of ſo glorious a truth.</p>
                  <p>But alas, I feare that my ſinnes, and the abuſe of ſo glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things as I have found, deprive me of ſo faire a Crowne; yet my Lord doth know, if he would call me to, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then me in it, it would be the moſt glorious day and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt houre I ever ſaw in this life; but I am in his hand to doe with me whatſoever ſhall pleaſe his Majeſty. It may ſuffice me that I have had ſo long a time in the knowledge of the Goſpell, and that I have ſeen the things I have ſeen, and heard the things I have heard, and that through Gods grace I have been ſo long a witneſſe of thoſe glorious and good newes in my weak miniſtery, and that my witneſſing hath not been altogether without fruit and bleſſing, ſo that I
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:135324:74"/>hope at that great day I ſhall have him to be my Crown, my glory, my joy and my reward, and therefore boldly I ſay with <hi>Simeon, Lord now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace,</hi> not in a peaceable dying, but by rendring up to him my ſpirit in ſtamping of this his verity, and in ſealing the ſame with my blood; <hi>I have fought a good fight, and have finiſhed my courſe,

                        <hi>This ſtrange Propheſie of</hi> Knox <hi>and</hi> Wiſhart <hi>is here explicat and mervailouſly enlarged by this divine man; the firſt part thereof, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone be here infists, has been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed lately in every tittle before our eyes; the ſecond part of Chriſts glorious reſurrection, and our glorious deliverance, we expect ſhall be as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually performed in the Lords good time.</hi>

                  <p>RIght honorable Sir; after my hearty ſalutations: Your love and care towards us uttered many wayes hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly comforted me; and having no other thing to requite, as I am able, I ſhall deſire the Lord who is mighty, and hath taken upon him ſo to doe, to meet you and yours with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations in his good time.</p>
                  <p>As for the matter it ſelfe, the bearer will ſhew you, that what is required is ſuch a thing as in the ſight of our Lord we may not doe, without both the hazard of our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and liberty of Chriſts Kingdome, which ſhould be deerer to us then any thing elſe; What a ſlavery were it for us to binde our conſciences in the ſervice of our God in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt point of our callings, to the will of man or Angels. And we are fully reſolved, that which we did, was acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to our God, who hath put it up as ſervice done to him, and has allowed and ſealed it to us by many tokens; ſo that it were more then high impiety and apoſtacy to teſtifie the ruine or undoing of any thing which our God hath ordained to be done, and has accepted of us being done

                  <p>Wee, Sir (if the Lord will) are yet ready to doe more in our callings, and to ſuffer more for the ſame, if ſo be it wil pleaſe our God to call us to it, and ſtrengthen us in it; for in our ſelves we dare promiſe nothing, but in our God all things.</p>
                  <p>As for that inſtrument <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> we are ſure the Lord will never bleſſe that man, but a malediction lyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and ſhall accompany all his doings; and it may be Sir, your eyes ſhall ſee as great confuſion covering him ere he goe to the grave, as did his predeceſſours. Now ſurely Sir, I am farre from bitterneſſe; but here I denounce the wrath of an everlaſting God againſt him, which aſſuredly ſhall fall, except it be prevented; Sir, Dagon ſhall not ſtand before the Arke of the Lord, and thoſe names of blaſphemy that he weares of Lord Biſhop and Archbiſhop will have a fearfull end
